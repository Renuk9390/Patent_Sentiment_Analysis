Therefore, ventilation resistance is relatively lower at the lower side of the second chamber than at the upper side of the second chamber. On this account, the evaporated fuel adsorbed by the second adsorbent accommodated in the second chamber is more easily desorbed at the lower side during the purge, and the amount of evaporated fuel remaining is smaller at the lower side. To be specific, the fuel component concentration in the second adsorbent is lower at the lower side by the purge. It should be noted that the wording “the passage is configured to extend substantially horizontally” in the first aspect of the present invention includes, for example, a case where a tilt angle of a tube axis of the passage with respect to a horizontal plane is between −30° and +30°.</p>', '<p id=""p-0015"" num=""0014"">With this, even when the fuel components adsorbed by the upper side of the second adsorbent move to the lower side by gravity during the stop of the engine, the lower side of the second adsorbent has an enough adsorption capacity, so that the fuel components moving toward the lower side can be adsorbed by the lower side of the second adsorbent. Therefore, as compared to conventional cases, it is possible to delay the start of the advancement of the fuel components in the second adsorbent toward the atmosphere release port.

To be specific, if the air layer is not provided between the flow dividing plate and the end portion, close to the atmosphere release port, of the second adsorbent, the air flowing from the atmosphere release port does not adequately flow into the second adsorbent contacting portions other than the communicating holes of the flow dividing plate. As a result, there is a possibility that the use efficiency of the second adsorbent deteriorates. However, according to the present invention, the air layer is provided between the flow dividing plate and the end portion, close to the atmosphere release port, of the second adsorbent. Therefore, the air flowing from the atmosphere release port easily flows into the second adsorbent through the end portion, close to the atmosphere release port, of the second adsorbent.

With this, the advancement of the remaining fuel components toward the atmosphere release port in the second adsorbent by capillarity becomes slower as the remaining fuel components get close to the atmosphere release port.

However, a degradation occurs at the same time due to the oxidative side reaction on the positive electrode. Thus, the addition of these compounds alone provides only an insufficient enhancement in battery characteristics.</p>', '<p id=""p-0070"" num=""0069"">The first aspect of the present invention is based on the finding that the above problem can be solved by the incorporation of an aromatic carboxylate ester represented by Formula (1) into a nonaqueous electrolytic solution.</p>', '<p id=""p-0071"" num=""0070"">As will be described below, the aromatic carboxylate ester represented by Formula (1) has a carbonyl group and an aromatic ring which are so separated from each other that their vacant orbitals are unlikely to overlap with each other. This configuration is probably the reason why the reductive side reaction on the negative electrode is suppressed from occurring. Specifically, the aromatic carboxylate ester represented by Formula (1) includes a carbon atom having a hydrocarbon group as a substituent between the carbonyl group and the aromatic ring. In such a structure, the overlapping of unoccupied orbitals of the carbonyl group and the aromatic ring is difficult to occur due to the steric hindrance of the hydrocarbon group. As a result, the occurrence of the reductive side reaction on the negative electrode is reduced to the minimum. Thus, the compound can form a film structure on the positive electrode without decrease in battery characteristics, thereby realizing an enhancement in battery characteristics. In another embodiment, the aromatic carboxylate ester represented by Formula (1) may include a carboxylate skeleton having a long alkylene chain between the carbonyl group and the aromatic ring. In such a structure, the carbonyl group and the aromatic ring are so separated from each other that the probability of the overlapping of their vacant orbitals is reduced. Consequently, the occurrence of the reductive side reaction on the negative electrode can be prevented. When the alkylene group is an ethylene group, the carbonyl group and the aromatic ring are separated from each other but their vacant orbitals have slight overlapping. Further, in the case where the ester moiety has an aromatic ring, the compound may have a decreased resistance to reduction because the three groups in the structure, namely, the aromatic ring in the carboxylate skeleton, the carbonyl group and the aromatic ring in the ester moiety interact with one another at the same time. In this case, the reductive side reaction can take place on the negative electrode. Thus, the aromatic carboxylate ester represented by Formula (1) has a requirement that when the alkylene group between the carbonyl group and the aromatic ring in the carboxylate skeleton is an ethylene group, the ester moiety is an aliphatic hydrocarbon group.</p>', '<p id=""p-0072"" num=""0071"">The second aspect of the present invention is based on the finding that the problem discussed hereinabove can be solved by the incorporation of both an aromatic carboxylate ester represented by Formula (2) and a compound (II) into a nonaqueous electrolytic solution.</p>', '<p id=""p-0073"" num=""0072"">When used alone, the aromatic carboxylate ester represented by Formula (2) will undergo the reductive side reaction on the negative electrode due to the overlapping of unoccupied orbitals of the aromatic ring and the carbonyl group in the carboxylate skeleton similarly to as described hereinabove, and will form a large amount of a film having low Li<sup>+</sup> conductivity. When, in contrast, the aromatic carboxylate ester represented by Formula (2) is used together with the compound (II), the compound (II) forms a film on the negative electrode which prevents the reductive side reaction of the aromatic carboxylate ester represented by Formula (2). Further, part of the aromatic carboxylate ester represented by Formula (2) is incorporated during the formation of a film of the compound (II) on the negative electrode. Consequently, a stable composite film having high Li<sup>+</sup> conductivity is formed. On the positive electrode, the aromatic carboxylate ester represented by Formula (2) forms a film structure which prevents the oxidative side reaction of the compound (II). As a result, initial battery characteristics and battery characteristics after durability testing can be enhanced at the same time without causing a decrease in battery characteristics.</p>']"
