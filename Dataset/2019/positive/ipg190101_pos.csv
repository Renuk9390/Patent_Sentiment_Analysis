3,US10166016B2,Medical retractor,utility,"['<p id=""p-0040"" num=""0039"">According to the present invention, there is provided the medical retractor capable of ensuring visibility of a field of operation and in the periphery of the field of operation while realizing the reduction in weight of the retractor compared to a conventional steel-made retractor. That is, according to the medical retractor of the present invention, an affected part which opposedly faces the back surface side of the resin functional portion is viewable through the hook-shaped portion. Accordingly, an affected part which is disposed in a shadow of the refractor and is not viewable if the medical retractor is formed of a steel-made retractor is viewable and hence, visibility of a field of operation can be largely increased compared to a conventional steel-made retractor. Also with respect to the trunk portion, an affected part which opposedly faces the back surface side is viewable and hence, even when a first retractor which retracts a tissue on a superficial layer side and a second retractor which retracts a tissue on a deep layer side are used simultaneously, it is possible to view the tissue which is retracted by the first retractor and is positioned on a back side of the second retractor through the trunk portion of the second retractor. Accordingly, visibility of a field of operation can be enhanced compared to the conventional medical retractor.</p>', '<p id=""p-0041"" num=""0040"">According to one embodiment of the invention, not to mention that light which is incident on the proximal end of the trunk portion from the light source of the grip portion is emitted from the distal ends and corner portions of the hook-shaped portion and the like and is irradiated to an affected part in the periphery of the medical retractor, leaked light is generated from a wall surface parallel to an advancing direction of light and hence, it is possible to largely increase visibility of an affected part which opposedly faces such a wall surface (back surface) when viewed from a wall surface (front surface) side on a side opposite to the affected part. Accordingly, the visibility of a field of operation can be enhanced compared to the prior art.</p>', '<p id=""p-0042"" num=""0041"">According to one embodiment of the invention, with such a medical retractor, it is possible to prevent a possibility that a liquid (body fluid, drug solution or the like) which has a possibility of being adhered to a connecting portion between the grip portion and the resin functional portion during an operation intrudes into the inside of the grip portion through a gap in the connecting portion. Accordingly, it is possible to eliminate lowering of light emitting intensity of the light source and short-circuiting of an inner electric system.</p>', '<p id=""p-0043"" num=""0042"">According to one embodiment of the invention, with such a medical retractor, light which is incident on the resin functional portion from the light source minimally leaks to the outside due to an effect of closing light in the layer boundary and hence, a quantity of light which reaches the hook-shaped portion extending from the distal end of the trunk portion can be increased. Further, by selecting a direction approximately orthogonal to the back surface of the resin functional portion as the direction of the layer boundary, it is possible to ensure leaked light to the back surface side at the same level or above corresponding to leaked light when a resin functional portion does not have the layered structure and hence, it is possible to prevent lowering of an effect of enhancing back-surface-side visibility by leaked light.</p>', '<p id=""p-0044"" num=""0043"">According to one embodiment of the invention, with such a medical retractor, the back surface and the front surface of the resin functional portion are respectively formed flat and hence, it is possible to ensure favorable visibility of an affected part which opposedly faces the back surface as viewed from a front surface side.

Further, even in the case where the medical retractor is provided with a light source, when light emission from the light source is stopped due to a power source condition, the light storage member emits light for a fixed time and hence, a field of vision can be maintained to some extent in a field of operation.</p>', '<p id=""p-0048"" num=""0047"">According to one embodiment of the invention, with such a medical retractor, light which advances through the trunk portion can easily advance toward the hook-shaped portion without being emitted to the outside at a bent portion. Accordingly, a quantity of light irradiated to a field of operation around the hook-shaped portion is increased and leaked light from the hook-shaped portion is also increased and hence, back-surface-side visibility can be enhanced.</p>', '<p id=""p-0049"" num=""0048"">According to one embodiment of the invention, with such a medical retractor, light which advances through the trunk portion can easily advance toward the hook-shaped portion without being emitted to the outside at a bent portion.

Further, the projecting height of the projection formed on the hook-shaped portion near an operation target part is set small and hence, shielding of a field of operation by the projection is lowered as much as possible. Further, the projection has the larger width and hence, back-surface-side visibility through the projection can be ensured to some extent.</p>']"

As shown later in a high-resolution TEM image, each layer is strongly bonded to each other in an atomic level. The anisotropy of hardness is expected to be reduced due to such a complex, alternating stacking of nano-layered crystals.

Accordingly, a portion of the second arm that protrudes in between the cam and the roller is small. Thus, when the variable valve mechanism of the present invention is installed instead of a valve mechanism (e.g., the conventional example 1) including no variable arm interposed between the cam and the roller, the second arm can be installed without forming such a large space therebetween. Consequently, the position change of the camshaft can be minimized. In particular, when the second arm can be interposed simply in a space that can be formed by changing the shape of the roller arm, for example, the position change of the camshaft is not necessary.</p>', '<p id=""p-0016"" num=""0015"">Because the second arm of the variable arm is pivotally supported by the support shaft, unlike the conventional example 2, the variable arm does not have to be surrounded and supported from three directions in a well-balanced manner by three members of the cam, the roller arm, and the variable device.
