Also with respect to the trunk portion, an affected part which opposedly faces the back surface side is viewable and hence, even when a first retractor which retracts a tissue on a superficial layer side and a second retractor which retracts a tissue on a deep layer side are used simultaneously, it is possible to view the tissue which is retracted by the first retractor and is positioned on a back side of the second retractor through the trunk portion of the second retractor.

In this dental therapy apparatus, the controller controls at least one of the pulse width and repetition frequency of the pulsed laser light, so as to selectively cut the carious part.</p>', '<p id=""p-0008"" num=""0007"">This structure uses a laser light source which emits laser light having a wavelength within the wavelength region of 5.7 to 6.6 μm and thus can selectively cut a carious part while less affecting sound parts, for example. Further, the controller pulse-drives the laser light source and controls at least one of the pulse width and repetition frequency of the pulsed laser light. This control can change cutting conditions (e.g., cutting speed), whereby the carious part can be cut further selectively. As a result, dental therapies can be performed more surely.</p>', '<p id=""p-0009"" num=""0008"">The controller may switch the control of the laser light source between a first mode of driving the laser light source at a pulse width shorter than a thermal relaxation time of an area irradiated with the pulsed laser light and a repetition frequency lower than that corresponding to the thermal relaxation time and a second mode of driving the laser light source at a pulse width longer than the thermal relaxation time and a repetition frequency higher than that corresponding to the thermal relaxation time.</p>', '<p id=""p-0010"" num=""0009"">Driving the laser light source in the first mode performs cutting with depressed thermal actions. Driving the laser light source in the second mode, on the other hand, makes it easier for heat to diffuse to the outside of the area irradiated with the pulsed laser light emitted from the laser light source. For example, an intraoral soft tissue such as a gum may be ablated when irradiated with laser light. Bleeding occurs in this case, but the soft tissue can coagulate when the surroundings of the irradiated area attain a fixed temperature or higher due to the thermal diffusion, thereby yielding a hemostatic effect. Therefore, even when a soft tissue about a carious part is damaged during cutting the carious part in the first mode, for example, switching to the second mode can stop the soft tissue from bleeding.</p>', '<p id=""p-0011"" num=""0010"">The laser light source may be a quantum cascade laser.

9,US10166103B2,Valve cusp sizer,utility,"['<p id=""p-0014"" num=""0013"">The inventor of the present invention diligently studied solutions for the above described problems of the conventional invention and obtained the following knowledge. That is, by removing a grip member and a grip member attachment portion from a conventional valve cusp sizer, and by forming a pinching portion to be held by a clamp, tweezers, or the like, it is possible to dramatically miniaturize the valve cusp sizer while maintaining necessary functions of the valve cusp sizer. The present inventor thought that the problems of the prior arts would be solved based on such knowledge, and completed the present invention. Specifically, the present invention has a structure described below.</p>', '<p id=""p-0015"" num=""0014"">The present invention relates to a valve cusp sizer. The valve cusp sizer is a surgical instrument used for determining (measuring) the size of a valve cusp conforming to the size of a cardiac valve.</p>', '<p id=""p-0016"" num=""0015"">The valve cusp sizer of the present invention includes a front surface <b>10</b> having an arcuate surface form to be abutted against an organism, a back surface <b>20</b> positioned on an opposite surface side of the front surface <b>10</b>, and a pinching portion <b>30</b> protruding from the back surface <b>20</b>. The front surface <b>10</b> is formed in the arcuate surface form so that a central part between left and right ends thereof projects toward a side of the organism. The pinching portion <b>30</b> is formed in a shape to be pinched by a surgical instrument. For example, if the pinching portion <b>30</b> is formed in a shape having flat surfaces at left and right sides thereof, the pinching portion <b>30</b> can be pinched by the surgical instrument.</p>', '<p id=""p-0017"" num=""0016"">Since the valve cusp sizer has the above described structure in which the pinching portion <b>30</b> is provided on the back surface <b>20</b> thereof, the pinching portion <b>30</b> can be pinched by a clamp or tweezers. This structure makes it unnecessary for the valve cusp sizer to be provided with a grip member to be gripped by hands. This grip member is a member occupying the most part of the structure in the conventional valve cusp sizer. Since the grip member may be omitted, the valve cusp sizer of the present invention can be miniaturized dramatically. The valve cusp sizer miniaturized in this manner can be inserted easily into the base of the narrow aorta. Further, a risk of injuring the organism by contacting the valve cusp sizer with the vessel wall of the aorta can be reduced. Moreover, since the valve cusp sizer is miniaturized, a plurality of types (for example, 9 types) of differently-sized valve cusp sizers can be accommodated in a small container. This makes it possible to keep a set of the valve cusp sizers around the operator\'s hand during an operation such as aortic valvuloplasty, and results in shortening an operative time.</p>', '<p id=""p-0018"" num=""0017"">In the valve cusp sizer of the present invention, the front surface <b>10</b> may preferably have left and right contact probe portions <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> at the left and right ends thereof to be contacted with left and right commissure portions of the valve cusp.</p>', '<p id=""p-0019"" num=""0018"">The above described structure, in which the contact probe portions <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> are provided on the front surface <b>10</b>, makes it possible to determine (measure) the size of the patient\'s valve cusp more appropriately.</p>', '<p id=""p-0020"" num=""0019"">In the valve cusp sizer of the present invention, the back surface <b>20</b> may preferably be formed in a shape projecting toward the same direction as the front surface <b>10</b> (for example, an arcuate surface form).</p>', '<p id=""p-0021"" num=""0020"">The above described structure, in which the back surface <b>20</b> is formed in the shape projecting toward the same direction as the front surface <b>10</b>, further miniaturizes the valve cusp sizer. That is, since an attachment portion of a grip member is necessary for the conventional valve cusp sizer (see <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 8</figref>) to be provided on the back surface <b>20</b> thereof, the back surface <b>20</b> projects toward a direction opposite to the front surface <b>10</b>. However, such a shape makes a head portion of the valve cusp sizer large and difficult to be inserted into the narrow aorta. Therefore, in the valve cusp sizer of the present invention, the attachment portion of the grip member has been removed from the back surface <b>20</b>, and the back surface <b>20</b> has been formed in the shape projecting toward the same direction as the front surface <b>10</b> (for example, an arcuate surface form).

The retracting prevention part includes a tape holding part holds the tape-shaped member together with the roller, and an upstream base end provided in a base end of the tape holding part on the tape feeding upstream side of the tape holding part, and in a position of being overlapped with the ribbon guide part when viewed from the bending direction.</p>', '<p id=""p-0010"" num=""0009"">With this configuration, the rigidity of the retracting prevention part is higher compared with a case where the retracting prevention part has the upstream base end. Thus, an amount by which the retracting prevention part is bent due to the tension of the tape-shaped member is small.</p>', '<p id=""p-0011"" num=""0010"">Therefore, even when the retracting prevention part is bent, the tip of the retracting prevention part does not approach the ribbon guide part particularly. Further, the upstream base end which opposes the ribbon guide part is not provided in the tip of the tape holding part. For this reason, it is suppressed that the ink ribbon is nipped between the ribbon guide part and the tip of the bent retracting prevention part. In addition, the retracting prevention part is bent to suppress that the longitudinal direction (hereinafter, referred to as a “tape length direction”) of the tape-shaped member is excessively curved in the area which reaches from the retracting prevention part to the roller.

The minute cracking has a depth of about 30 μm or less from the interface between the coating layer and the steel substrate (steel sheet), and passes through the interface between the coating layer and the steel substrate (steel sheet) and reaches the inside of the steel sheet. As a result of making various research on this problem, we discovered that microcracks are completely suppressed by setting the temperature of the coated steel sheet during hot press forming to about 400° C. or less. Further, the effect of significantly reducing the amount of coating attached to the press mold was obtained by setting the temperature of the coated steel sheet during hot press forming to about 400° C. or less as mentioned above.</p>', '<p id=""p-0020"" num=""0019"">However, when the temperature of the steel sheet during press forming is lower, the strength of the steel sheet is higher, and so the press forming load increases. Besides, when the temperature of the steel sheet during press forming is lower, the ductility of the steel sheet is lower, and so the steel sheet is more susceptible to fracture during forming. Thus, the advantages of the hot press forming cannot be exploited if the temperature of the steel sheet during the press forming is lower. These problems are noticeable especially when the temperature of the coated steel sheet throughout the sheet thickness is about 400° C. or less during the press forming, leading to new problems such as lower quality or lower productivity or yield rate of the press formed part.</p>', '<p id=""p-0021"" num=""0020"">We then conceived hot press forming in the state where only the surface layer part of the coated steel sheet is cooled.

A blank sheet of 200 mm×400 mm was then punched from the coated steel sheet.</p>', '<p id=""p-0025"" num=""0024"">A press forming test was conducted first, using the obtained blank sheet. In detail, the blank sheet was uniformly heated to 900° C., and then allowed to cool to 700° C.

After this, the blank sheet was held in the press mold for 15 s to cool to 120° C. or less and released from the press mold, thus obtaining a hat-shaped press formed part illustrated in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 1</figref>. The press forming performed was deep drawing with a punch-die clearance of 1.6 mm and a blank holding force of 10 tonf.</p>', '<p id=""p-0026"" num=""0025"">Here, the surface of the blank sheet was water-cooled under various conditions by changing the water temperature in the range of 10° C. to 30° C., the density of water quantity in the range of 10 L/m<sup>2</sup>·min to 100000 L/m<sup>2</sup>·min, and the time of water injection in the range of 0.1 s to 10.0 s.

However, the press forming load varied in the range of 180 tonf to 600 tonf during press forming, depending on the condition with which the surface of the blank sheet was water-cooled.</p>', '<p id=""p-0028"" num=""0027"">In view of this, the same type of blank sheet (200 mm×400 mm) as above was uniformly heated to 900° C., and then allowed to cool to 700° C. At this point, the surface of the blank sheet was cooled under various conditions to be at 400° C. or less, as in the press forming test. After this, the blank sheet was left without being press formed, and the temperature hysteresis of the surface of the blank sheet was measured using a radiation thermometer. As the result, in the case where the blank sheet was water-cooled under the cooling condition, in the press forming test where the press forming load varied in the range of 180 tonf to 600 tonf, corresponding to a relatively low press forming load of 300 tonf or less and then left without being press formed, the following phenomenon was observed as illustrated in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 2</figref>: After the surface of the blank sheet was cooled to 400° C. or less during the period corresponding to the press forming time (the time required from when the blank sheet is set in the press mold to when the punch reaches the bottom dead center), the surface temperature of the blank sheet increased to 500° C. or more due to heat recuperation. It can be concluded that, in such a case where the surface temperature significantly increased due to heat recuperation, the inside of the blank sheet was kept at high temperature even though the surface of the blank sheet was cooled to 400° C. or less. On the other hand, in the case where the blank sheet was water-cooled under a water cooling condition corresponding to a relatively high press forming load exceeding 300 tonf and then left without being press formed, the heat recuperation phenomenon was not observed or, even when observed, the temperature increase was small.</p>', '<p id=""p-0029"" num=""0028"">These results reveal that, in the case where the press forming load is relatively low, i.e. 300 tonf or less, the surface temperature of the blank sheet during press forming is 400° C. or less and also there is a temperature distribution in the thickness direction of the blank sheet. However, the internal temperature of the blank sheet during press forming in the case where the press forming load is relatively low, i.e. 300 tonf or less, cannot be obtained from these results. Hence, we determined the average temperature of the blank sheet having the temperature distribution by the following method.</p>', '<p id=""p-0030"" num=""0029"">The same type of blank sheet (200 mm×400 mm) as above was heated to 900° C., uniformly air-cooled to various temperatures, and press formed.

The press forming load was then measured for each blank sheet temperature during press forming. Here, the blank sheet temperature during press forming was measured from the blank sheet immediately before being inserted into the press mold, using a radiation thermometer. The time required from the measurement of the blank sheet temperature to the press forming is about 1.5 s, and a temperature decrease during this period is negligible.</p>', '<p id=""p-0031"" num=""0030""><figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 3</figref> is a graph illustrating the relationship between the blank sheet temperature and the press forming load in the case of uniformly cooling the blank sheet.

When the blank sheet temperature was about 500° C. or more, the press forming load was 300 tonf or less. It can be assumed from these results that the average temperature of the blank sheet during press forming is about 500° C. or more in the case where the surface temperature of the blank sheet during press forming is 400° C. or less and the press forming load is 300 tonf or less.</p>', '<p id=""p-0032"" num=""0031"">These results reveal that microcracks can be effectively suppressed without an increase in press forming load or a fracture of the blank sheet, by setting the blank sheet temperature during press forming so that the surface temperature is 400° C. or less and the average temperature is 500° C. or more. In a conventional hot press forming method such as the hot press forming method proposed in PTL 3, the blank sheet is press formed under the condition that the blank sheet temperature is uniform throughout the sheet thickness, as illustrated in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 4(<i>a</i>)</figref>. In such a case, microcracks cannot be sufficiently suppressed, and the characteristics (fatigue resistance, etc.) of the hot press formed part degrade. In the case where the blank sheet having the desired temperature distribution as illustrated in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 4(<i>b</i>)</figref> is press formed, on the other hand, microcracks can be suppressed without an increase in press forming load or a fracture of the blank sheet.</p>', '<p id=""p-0033"" num=""0032"">As a result of calculating the temperature of the center position of the blank sheet in the thickness direction by heat transfer calculation based on the temperature hysteresis of the surface of the blank sheet illustrated in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 2</figref>, the temperature of the center position of the blank sheet in the thickness direction in the period corresponding to the press forming time was presumed at about 530° C. or more.

Then, by controlling the degree of opening of each throttle valve and the degree of opening of an EGR valve of the EGR device during the execution of fuel cut processing to predetermined states, respectively, according to the temperature of a three-way catalyst, it is made possible to suppress the deterioration of a noble metal by oxidation in a suitable manner.</p>', '<p id=""p-0011"" num=""0010"">More specifically, the present disclosure resides in a control apparatus for a naturally aspirated gasoline engine which comprises: a three-way catalyst that is arranged in an exhaust passage of said gasoline engine; a first throttle valve that is arranged in an intake passage of said gasoline engine; a second throttle valve that is arranged in said intake passage at the downstream side of said first throttle valve; and an EGR device including an EGR passage that recirculates an EGR gas, which is a part of an exhaust gas discharged from said gasoline engine, to said intake passage between said first throttle valve and said second throttle valve, and an EGR valve that is arranged in said EGR passage; and a controller comprising at least one processor configured to carry out fuel cut processing, which is processing to stop ignition by a spark plug and fuel injection by a fuel injection valve during operation of said gasoline engine; wherein in cases where said controller carries out said fuel cut processing and where the temperature of said three-way catalyst is equal to or higher than a predetermined temperature, said controller may introduce said EGR gas into a cylinder of said gasoline engine as intake air by fully closing said first throttle valve and by opening said EGR valve, and may further control an amount of said EGR gas by adjusting the degree of opening of said second throttle valve.</p>', '<p id=""p-0012"" num=""0011"">In the naturally aspirated gasoline engine to which the control apparatus according to the present disclosure is applied, the EGR device is formed of the EGR passage and the EGR valve. Then, the first throttle valve and the second throttle valve are arranged in the intake passage in this order from the upstream side thereof, and further, the EGR passage through which the EGR gas flows merges or joins at an intake side to a portion of the intake passage between the first throttle valve and the second throttle valve (hereinafter, this may be referred to as an “interthrottle intake passage”). Accordingly, when the EGR gas arrives at the intake passage, it will be supplied into the cylinder through the second throttle valve. In addition, fresh air to be supplied into the cylinder from the intake passage at the upstream side of the first throttle valve is supplied into the cylinder through the first throttle valve and the second throttle valve.</p>', '<p id=""p-0013"" num=""0012"">Here, in said naturally aspirated gasoline engine, if the first throttle valve at the upstream side is fully opened in cases where the operating state of said naturally aspirated gasoline engine falls within a low load region (such a situation being referred to as “at the time of the low load region”), negative pressure becomes relatively small in the merge portion of the EGR passage and the intake passage, even at the time of the low load region. In such a case, a pressure difference between the upstream side (the exhaust passage side) and the downstream side (the intake passage side) of the EGR valve arranged in the EGR passage becomes small, and it becomes possible to control the amount of recirculation of the EGR gas by the adjustment of the EGR valve with a high degree of accuracy.</p>', '<p id=""p-0014"" num=""0013"">When the fuel cut processing is carried out at the time of deceleration of the vehicle on which the naturally aspirated gasoline engine is mounted, it is desirable, from the point of view of the deterioration of the noble metal supported by the three-way catalyst by oxidation, to suppress the amount of oxygen flowing into the three-way catalyst as much as possible in the case where the temperature of the three-way catalyst is relatively high. Accordingly, in the naturally aspirated gasoline engine according to the present disclosure, at the time of carrying out the fuel cut processing to stop the ignition by the spark plug and the fuel injection by the fuel injection valve during the operation of said gasoline engine, and in the case where the temperature of the three-way catalyst arranged in the exhaust passage is equal to or higher than the predetermined temperature (such a situation being referred to as “at the time of carrying out the fuel cut processing in the high temperature state of the three-way catalyst”), said controller included in said control apparatus for a naturally aspirated gasoline engine suppresses oxygen from flowing into the three-way catalyst at the time of carrying out the fuel cut processing in the high temperature state of the three-way catalyst as much as possible, by controlling the first throttle valve, the second throttle valve and the EGR valve.</p>', '<p id=""p-0015"" num=""0014"">Specifically, at the time of carrying out the fuel cut processing in the high temperature state of the three-way catalyst, said controller may open the EGR valve while fully closing the first throttle valve. As a result of this, the inflow of fresh air from the portion of the intake passage at the upstream side of the first throttle valve to a portion of the intake passage at the downstream side thereof will be stopped, and only the EGR gas having passed through the EGR passage merged or joined to the intake passage will be supplied to the interthrottle intake passage. Then, the intake air (substantially, the EGR gas) existing in the interthrottle intake passage is supplied into the cylinder through the second throttle valve. Accordingly, at this time, the EGR gas will be introduced, as intake air, into the cylinder of the naturally aspirated gasoline engine. Moreover, said controller may control the amount of the EGR gas to be sucked into the cylinder by adjusting the degree of opening of the second throttle valve. With this, the negative pressure in the intake passage at the downstream side of the second throttle valve at the time of the execution of the fuel cut processing in the high temperature state of the three-way catalyst is controlled to a desired negative pressure at which a feeling of vehicle deceleration can be obtained. In addition, in view of the fact that at this time, the EGR gas is introduced as intake air and the inflow of fresh air into the cylinder is stopped, and that intake air passes through the interior of the cylinder and is discharged into the exhaust passage as it is at the time of carrying out the fuel cut processing, in the naturally aspirated gasoline engine according to the present disclosure, the inflow of fresh air to the three-way catalyst is stopped in principle at the time of carrying out the fuel cut processing in the high temperature state of the three-way catalyst. This can suppress oxygen from flowing into the three-way catalyst as much as possible at the time of carrying out the fuel cut processing in the high temperature state of the three-way catalyst. Then, at this time, it is not necessary to make large the throttling of the second throttle valve for the purpose of suppressing the inflow of fresh air to the three-way catalyst, and hence, there is only a small possibility that a relatively large negative pressure occurs in the cylinder, so that oil rise (oil loss via the piston ring) can be suppressed.</p>', '<p id=""p-0016"" num=""0015"">As mentioned above, in the naturally aspirated gasoline engine according to the present disclosure, because oxygen can be suppressed from flowing into the three-way catalyst as much as possible at the time of carrying out the fuel cut processing in the high temperature state of the three-way catalyst, it becomes possible to suppress the deterioration of the noble metal supported by the three-way catalyst by oxidation, and further, the feeling of vehicle deceleration can be obtained during the execution of the fuel cut processing, and oil rise (oil loss via the piston ring) can be suppressed.</p>', '<p id=""p-0017"" num=""0016"">In addition, when carrying out the fuel cut processing, the controller included in the control apparatus for a naturally aspirated gasoline engine according to the present disclosure may stop the ignition of said spark plug after said first throttle valve begins to be closed, and may continue the fuel injection of said fuel injection valve until said first throttle valve is fully closed. Then, said controller may stop the ignition and the fuel injection in an intake air control state in which said first throttle valve is fully closed and said EGR valve is opened. In such a naturally aspirated gasoline engine, the ignition of the spark plug may be stopped after the first throttle valve begins to be closed and before said first throttle valve is fully closed. Moreover, in the process in which the first throttle valve is fully closed, the amount of fresh air in the intake air sucked into the cylinder will decrease, and the amount of the EGR gas therein will increase (i.e., the EGR ratio in the intake air will become higher). If the ignition of the spark plug is carried out in such a situation, there is a fear that a misfire resulting from an increase in the EGR ratio may occur. Accordingly, in said naturally aspirated gasoline engine, in such a situation, the misfire resulting from the increase in the EGR ratio becomes difficult to occur, by stopping the ignition of the spark plug in the process in which the first throttle valve is fully closed. As a result, the occurrence of variation in the torque of the naturally aspirated gasoline engine can be suppressed.</p>', '<p id=""p-0018"" num=""0017"">Here, in said naturally aspirated gasoline engine, although the ignition of the spark plug is stopped when the first throttle valve has not arrived at its fully closed state (i.e., when the first throttle valve opens to no small extent), the fuel injection of the fuel injection valve is continued at this time. Then, the fuel injected is discharged together with fresh air from the cylinder into the exhaust passage as it is, and flows into the three-way catalyst, without being combusted within the cylinder. Here, in the three-way catalyst, the fuel discharged from the cylinder and the oxygen contained in the fresh air discharged from the cylinder react with each other. In other words, the oxygen contained in the fresh air passing through the interior of the cylinder and flowing into the three-way catalyst while ignition has been stopped will be consumed by the fuel which passes through the interior of the cylinder and flows into the three-way catalyst, similar to said fresh air. Due to this, in the process in which the first throttle valve arrives at its fully closed state, too, the deterioration of the noble metal by oxidation resulting from the inflow of the fresh air to the three-way catalyst can be suppressed, as in the case where the first throttle valve has been made into the fully closed state. Here, note that if ignition is stopped and fuel injection is continued before the first throttle valve begins to be closed, the amount of the fresh air flowing into the three-way catalyst will become relatively large, and the amount of oxygen reacting in the three-way catalyst will also become large, as a result of which the temperature rise of the three-way catalyst resulting from the reaction of oxygen therein becomes relatively large. In contrast to this, however, in the present disclosure, ignition is stopped and fuel injection is continued in the process in which the first throttle valve is being fully closed, so the amount of the fresh air flowing into the three-way catalyst will become relatively small, and the temperature rise of the three-way catalyst resulting from the reaction of oxygen therein becomes relatively small.</p>', '<p id=""p-0019"" num=""0018"">Further, when carrying out the fuel cut processing, the controller included in the control apparatus for a naturally aspirated gasoline engine according to the present disclosure may stop the ignition of said spark plug after said first throttle valve begins to be closed, and may continue the fuel injection of said fuel injection valve until a first predetermined period of time has elapsed from the formation of said intake air control state. Then, said controller may stop the ignition in the intake air control state, and may stop the ignition and the fuel injection after the first predetermined period of time has elapsed from the formation of the intake air control state.

However, for some period of time after said controller forms said intake air control state for the first throttle valve and the EGR valve, the fresh air remaining in the intake passage connected with the cylinder at the downstream side of the first throttle valve (hereinafter, this may be referred to as “residual fresh air”.) will be sucked into the cylinder together with the EGR gas. With this, the residual fresh air sucked into the cylinder together with the EGR gas will be discharged from the cylinder together with the EGR gas as it is, and will flow into the three-way catalyst, and hence, this is not preferable from the view point of the deterioration of the noble metal supported by the three-way catalyst by oxidation.</p>', '<p id=""p-0021"" num=""0020"">Accordingly, said controller included in said control apparatus for a naturally aspirated gasoline engine continues the fuel injection of the fuel injection valve for a period of time from the formation of said intake air control state for the first throttle valve and the EGR valve until the first predetermined period of time, which is a period of time in which the residual fresh air can flow into the three-way catalyst, has elapsed, so that the fuel passing through the interior of the cylinder to flow into the three-way catalyst and the oxygen contained in the residual fresh air are made to react with each other in the three-way catalyst.

According to this, the inflow of the fresh air from the portion of the intake passage at the upstream side of the first throttle valve to the portion of the intake passage at the downstream side thereof is started, and the recirculation of the EGR gas from the EGR passage is stopped. Accordingly, the fresh air will be introduced into the cylinder as intake air. In addition, the pressure in the portion of the intake passage at the downstream side of the second throttle valve becomes able to be controlled by controlling the amount of the fresh air to be introduced by means of the adjustment of the opening degree of the second throttle valve. Moreover, said controller may start the fuel injection of said fuel injection valve in response to said first throttle valve beginning to be opened, and may start the ignition of said spark plug after a second predetermined period of time has elapsed from the beginning of the opening of the first throttle valve.</p>', '<p id=""p-0024"" num=""0023"">Here, in the naturally aspirated gasoline engine according to the present disclosure, at the time of carrying out the fuel cut processing and in the case where the temperature of the three-way catalyst arranged in the exhaust passage is equal to or higher than the predetermined temperature, i.e., at the time of carrying out the fuel cut processing in the high temperature state of the three-way catalyst, said intake air control state is formed for the first throttle valve and the EGR valve, and hence, the EGR gas is filled in the portion of the intake passage connected with the cylinder at the downstream side of the first throttle valve.

The rotating object has a rotating surface, and an irregular uneven portion on the rotating surface, the uneven portions having projections and depressions. The received light data obtaining unit obtains time-series data of received light data of light reflected by the uneven portion. The rotational speed calculation unit calculates the rotational speed of the rotating object from periodicity of the time-series data.</p>', '<p id=""p-0013"" num=""0012"">According to the above configuration, when the irregular uneven portion is illuminated with light from the light emitting unit, light waves reflected from different points on the irregular uneven portion interfere with each other, resulting in irregular received light data of light received by the light receiving unit.

Time-series data having periodicity corresponding to the rotation of the rotating object emerges from the irregular received light data. The rotational speed calculation unit can precisely and readily calculate the rotational speed of the rotating object from the periodicity of the time-series data. As a result, the rotational speed of the rotating object can be detected with high precision by a simple control using a relatively inexpensive and compact optical device without performing, for example, advanced image processing using an expensive and large image capture means. Moreover, for example, even if the rotational speed of the rotating object is high, the periodicity of the time-series data is maintained, and therefore, the rotational speed of the rotating object that rotates at high speed can be detected with high precision.

As a result, they have discovered that, in a battery having a flat wound electrode assembly, when surplus nonaqueous electrolyte more than amply supplied within the battery case is present in addition to the nonaqueous electrolyte that impregnates into the electrode assembly, this surplus electrolyte tends to freeze. In addition, the inventors have learned that, quite apart from adjusting the makeup of the nonaqueous electrolyte, adding a suitable amount of an inorganic aggregate to the nonaqueous electrolyte is highly effective for suppressing viscosity increases and freezing of the nonaqueous electrolyte. The art disclosed herein was ultimately arrived at based on these findings.</p>', '<p id=""p-0008"" num=""0007"">Accordingly, this invention provides a nonaqueous electrolyte secondary battery having a flat wound electrode assembly, a nonaqueous electrolyte, and a battery case which houses the flat wound electrode assembly and the nonaqueous electrolyte. The flat wound electrode assembly is formed from a strip-shaped positive electrode and a strip-shaped negative electrode which are arranged with a separator therebetween and wound in such a manner that the assembly has an oval cross-sectional shape perpendicular to a winding axis. The nonaqueous electrolyte contains an insulating inorganic aggregate and is formed of an impregnating electrolyte that is impregnated into the flat wound electrode assembly and a surplus electrolyte that is not impregnated into the flat wound electrode assembly. The battery case includes a prismatic case body having an opening therein for inserting the flat wound electrode assembly, and a sealing member for sealing the opening in the case body. When the battery case is placed on a horizontal surface so that the sealing member becomes the top side of the battery case, the flat wound electrode assembly is housed within the battery case in such a manner that the major axis of the oval is vertically oriented. Letting the flat wound electrode assembly be divided into a planar region where the electrode surfaces are planar surfaces, an upper wound curved region which is positioned vertically upward from the planar region and where the electrode faces are curved surfaces, and a lower wound curved region which is positioned vertically downward from the planar region and where the electrode faces are curved surfaces, and letting a space between the battery case and the flat wound electrode assembly be divided by a boundary plane B that includes a boundary between the planar region and the lower wound curved region, an amount M<sub>O </sub>of the inorganic aggregate included in a space which is outside of the flat wound electrode assembly and below the boundary plane B and an amount M<sub>I </sub>of the inorganic aggregate included in the impregnating electrolyte within the entire flat wound electrode assembly satisfy the relationship M<sub>O</sub>>M<sub>I</sub>.</p>', '<p id=""p-0009"" num=""0008"">From the findings of the inventors, it was apparent that an increase in viscosity and freezing of the nonaqueous electrolyte in very low-temperature environments can clearly arise in the surplus nonaqueous electrolyte (surplus electrolyte) that does not impregnate the electrode assembly and is present in the lower part of the battery case. With the foregoing arrangement, viscosity increases and freezing in very low-temperature environments can be reliably suppressed, thus making it possible, for example, to suppress a rise in the battery resistance and to prevent a decrease in the battery characteristics (e.g., high-rate discharge characteristics).</p>', '<p id=""p-0010"" num=""0009"">In this Description, “oval” refers to a combined shape obtained by dividing a circle at the diameter thereof into two semicircles and inserting between the two semicircles a rectangle whose short sides correspond to the diameter of the circle, and includes such shapes as barrel shapes and track shapes (see <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 2</figref>).

The exposed current collector region of the positive electrode and the exposed current collector region of the negative electrode are arranged so as to protrude from, respectively, a first edge and a second edge of the wound electrode assembly in a width direction perpendicular to the lengthwise direction, and the positive electrode and the negative electrode are wound using the width direction as the axis of winding.
