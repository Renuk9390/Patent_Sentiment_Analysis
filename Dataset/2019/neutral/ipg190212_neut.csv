In addition, the explosive substance means a substance capable of causing an abrupt combustion reaction. In general, the explosive substances are roughly classified into solid high explosives having no fluidity at normal temperature and normal pressure and liquid high explosives having fluidity at normal temperature and normal pressure.

During the detonation, the raw material substance is in a high-temperature high-pressure state due to a decomposition reaction. However, it is immediately expanded and cooled. A process from this high-temperature high-pressure state to the reduced-pressure cooling is caused within a very short time as compared with usual combustion or deflagration that is an explosion phenomenon slower than the detonation, and therefore, there is no time when the aggregated carbon largely grows.

Here, when an atmosphere in the chamber does not contain an oxygen gas, and/or when the coolant is a substance which does not substantially produce an oxidative substance such as oxygen or ozone, an oxidation reaction can be inhibited.

The first catalyst region contains a support and any one or two species of precious metal selected from platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), and rhodium (Rh) loaded on the support. The second catalyst region contains a support and any one or two species of precious metal selected from Pt, Pd, and Rh loaded on the support and other than at least the precious metal present in the first catalyst region.</p>', '<p id=""p-0012"" num=""0011"">Sintering (alloying) between the plurality of precious metal species is effectively suppressed with this exhaust gas purification apparatus because the plurality of precious metal species are supported separately in the small pores (first catalyst region) and large pores (second catalyst region) of the partition. Due to this, catalyst deterioration is inhibited even when exposure to high temperatures occurs. In addition, because both the first catalyst region and the second catalyst region are disposed in the interior of the partition, the increase in flow path resistance that occurs when a catalyst region is formed on the surface of the partition is avoided and the pressure loss can then be reduced. Moreover, the exhaust gas is efficiently contacted with the precious metal in a plurality of reaction fields because a plurality of precious metal species are present within the partition in a randomly dispersed state along the flow direction of the exhaust gas.

The incorporation of an NOx absorber in such a first catalyst region makes it possible to achieve an efficient purification of the NOx present in the exhaust gas. Because, in this case, the NOx absorber is disposed within the partition in a randomly dispersed state along the exhaust gas flow direction, the NOx in the exhaust gas passing through the interior of the partition can be favorably absorbed and released. A higher purification performance can be achieved as a consequence.</p>', '<p id=""p-0017"" num=""0016"">In a preferred aspect of the herein disclosed exhaust gas purification apparatus, the second catalyst region contains an OSC material that has an oxygen storage capacity (for example, CeO<sub>2 </sub>or CeO<sub>2</sub>—ZrO<sub>2 </sub>composite oxide). Through the incorporation of an OSC material in such a second catalyst region, a stable catalytic performance is obtained and the purification performance of the catalyst is improved. Because, in this case, the OSC material is disposed within the partition in a randomly dispersed state along the exhaust gas flow direction, the oxygen in the exhaust gas passing through the interior of the partition can be favorably absorbed and released.

In addition, when the molar ratio is 0.5 or less, it is possible to prevent deterioration of NOx purifying performance due to ammonia oxidation at a high temperature.

The reason is that, when the SiO<sub>2</sub>/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>is less than 15, the amount of alumina is increased and the amount of carried Cu serving as a catalyst can be proportionately increased. When the SAR is less than 15, since the amount of Cu salt in the powder mixture is increased relative to the zeolite, the effect due to the solid-state ion exchange can be further exerted.</p>', '<p id=""p-0021"" num=""0020"">In the method for producing the zeolite of the present invention, an average particle size is preferably 0.5 μm or less in the zeolite having the CHA structure in which Cu is carried.

The above-mentioned term “transverse direction” herein refers to a horizontal direction, or a direction inclined upward or downward with respect to the horizontal direction within a range of less than 45° (preferably, a direction inclined within a range of less than 30°) (the same applies hereinafter).</p>', '<p id=""p-0022"" num=""0021"">With such configuration, even when wrinkles are generated in the glass film ribbon that is being conveyed in the transverse direction by the transverse conveyance unit, the wrinkles are smoothed by the wrinkle-smoothing unit arranged in the transverse conveyance unit before the glass film ribbon is cleaved by the cleaving unit. Therefore, the wrinkles generated in the glass film ribbon are eliminated properly, and thereafter, the glass film ribbon is cleaved along the preset cleaving line extending in the longitudinal direction by a laser cleaving method or the like. Therefore, an inappropriate bending stress or the like is not generated in the glass film, and satisfactory cleaving may be performed stably. Note that, in a configuration in which the glass film ribbon is conveyed by the transverse conveyance unit via a direction changing unit from a forming unit, the wrinkles generated in the glass film are smoothed and eliminated with the wrinkle-smoothing unit. Therefore, a situation in which the wrinkles are pushed to an upstream side to arrive at the direction changing unit or the vicinity thereof does not occur. Thus, for example, the glass film ribbon does not wobble in the direction changing unit owing to the wrinkles, thereby eliminating a risk in that the forming unit is adversely affected.</p>', '<p id=""p-0023"" num=""0022"">In such configuration, it is preferred that the wrinkle-smoothing unit be arranged on a lower surface side of the glass film ribbon conveyed by the transverse conveyance unit.</p>', '<p id=""p-0024"" num=""0023"">With this, a free space above the glass film ribbon in the transverse conveyance unit becomes larger, with the result that the space may be used effectively, and the interference between the wrinkle-smoothing unit and the cleaving unit is avoided.

The term “rod-like body” herein encompasses a hollow (pipe-like) rod-like body as well as a solid rod-like body (the same applies hereinafter).</p>', '<p id=""p-0026"" num=""0025"">With this, the wrinkles generated on the upstream side of the cleaving position of the glass film ribbon are mostly smoothed and eliminated while the glass film ribbon is being conveyed so as to run on the orthogonal rod-like body extending in the direction orthogonal to the conveyance direction. In other words, when the glass film ribbon is lifted up from the lower surface side with the orthogonal rod-like body, the wrinkles generated in the glass film ribbon are smoothed with an action of the lift-up force.

Thus, of the wrinkles generated in the glass film ribbon, in particular, the wrinkles along the conveyance direction are smoothed reliably and efficiently. Further, the parallel rod-like body is arranged over the region from the upstream side to the downstream side of the cleaving position. Therefore, the parallel rod-like body causes the lift-up force to act on a cleaving part even after cleaving is performed, and hence opposing cleaving end surfaces in the cleaving part are to be separated from each other.

That is, generally in both the end portions in the width direction of the glass film ribbon, parts that are to be convex upward and parts that are to be convex downward are repeatedly formed adjacently in the longitudinal direction during the transverse conveyance. In the current circumstances, the following situation has occurred. Along with the conveyance, the parts that are convex upward are inverted to parts that are convex downward, and the parts that are convex downward are inverted to the parts that are convex upward. When such situation occurs, vibration occurs in both the end portions in the width direction of the glass film ribbon, and the vibration propagates to the cleaving position. Therefore, there arises a serious problem in that the cleaving with the cleaving unit is inevitably stopped. However, in the present invention, both the end portions in the width direction of the glass film ribbon are each held from above by the holding body so that all the parts that are convex upward and the parts that are convex downward are kept convex downward forcibly, and thus the transverse conveyance can be performed in such state. Accordingly, the phenomenon in which the parts that are to be convex upward and the parts that are to be convex downward are inverted may not occur, and along with this, the occurrence of vibration is suppressed, with the result that cleaving with the cleaving unit is performed smoothly and satisfactorily.</p>', '<p id=""p-0037"" num=""0036"">In the above-mentioned configurations, the wrinkle-smoothing unit may be constructed by arranging each parallel rod-like body on the downstream side of the orthogonal rod-like body.</p>', '<p id=""p-0038"" num=""0037"">With this, the action and effect obtained by arranging the orthogonal rod-like body described above and the action and effect obtained by arranging the parallel rod-like body can be obtained at once simultaneously.</p>', '<p id=""p-0039"" num=""0038"">In the above-mentioned configurations, the wrinkle-smoothing unit may be constructed by arranging the bedplate on the downstream side of the orthogonal rod-like body and mounting the parallel rod-like body in an upper portion of each of both the end portions in the width direction of the bedplate.</p>', '<p id=""p-0040"" num=""0039"">With this, the wrinkles generated in the glass film ribbon along the conveyance direction can be smoothed more reliably by mounting the parallel rod-like body in the upper portion of each of both the end portions in the width direction of the bedplate, and in addition, the wrinkles having various directivities can be smoothed efficiently over a wider range by arranging those components on the downstream side of the orthogonal rod-like body.</p>']"

49,US10202667B2,High strength hot rolled steel sheet and method for manufacturing the same,utility,"['<p id=""p-0022"" num=""0021"">In order to solve the above-described issues, intensive studies were conducted on various factors which affect the strength and the strength uniformity of a hot rolled steel sheet.</p>', '<p id=""p-0023"" num=""0022"">As is generally known, a main factor behind the strength variations in the sheet width direction of a hot rolled steel sheet is a temperature decrease of the end portion in the width direction of the steel sheet (or steel) in each step of production of the hot rolled steel sheet. In particular, in the cooling step after completion of the hot rolling, the end portion in the sheet width direction of the steel sheet is supercooled, and this supercooling causes considerable temperature decrease of the end portion and, therefore, is an important factor behind the strength variations in the sheet width direction.</p>', '<p id=""p-0024"" num=""0023"">Then, studies were initially conducted on the technology to reduce influences exerted on strength variations by a temperature decrease of the end portion in the sheet width direction, which occurs in the cooling step after completion of the hot rolling.</p>', '<p id=""p-0025"" num=""0024"">As for the technique to improve the steel sheet strength, a technique to specify the parent phase microstructure of the hot rolled steel sheet to be a low temperature transformation phase, e.g., bainite or martensite, is considered. However, in order to produce a hot rolled steel sheet in which the parent phase microstructure of the hot rolled steel sheet is specified to be a low temperature transformation phase, it is necessary that the coiling temperature be set at lower than 600° C. Consequently, it is difficult to mitigate the influence exerted on strength variations by a temperature decrease of the end portion in the sheet width direction, which occurs in the cooling step after completion of the hot rolling. Meanwhile, in the case where the parent phase microstructure of the hot rolled steel sheet was specified to be a low temperature transformation phase, it was feared that the ductility and the like of the steel sheet were degraded and the workability was adversely affected. Then, it was noted that the technology aiming at enhancing the strength of the steel sheet by specifying the parent phase microstructure of the hot rolled steel sheet to be a ferrite single microstructure and finely dispersing carbides into the ferrite phase.</p>', '<p id=""p-0026"" num=""0025"">The ferrite phase is basically a mild metal microstructure and the strength of the steel sheet can be enhanced without causing degradation of the ductility and the like by precipitating fine carbides into the ferrite. Therefore, the strength of the steel sheet can be enhanced while the workability is maintained by specifying the parent phase microstructure of the hot rolled steel sheet to be a substantially ferrite single microstructure and finely precipitating carbides into the ferrite phase.</p>', '<p id=""p-0027"" num=""0026"">However, in such a case as well, it is still difficult to suppress strength variations caused by a temperature decrease of the end portion in the sheet width direction. This is because the amount of precipitation and the size (particle diameter) of fine carbides, which contribute to enhancement of the strength of the hot rolled steel sheet, depend on the cooling stop temperature in the cooling step after completion of the hot rolling, the coiling temperature, and the cooling rate after the coiling.</p>', '<p id=""p-0028"" num=""0027"">The hot rolled steel sheet having a microstructure in which carbides are precipitated in the ferrite phase is obtained usually by heating a steel to a y region for the purpose of dissolving coarse carbides precipitated in the steel, performing hot rolling, and precipitating carbides along with γ→α transformation in the cooling step after completion of the hot rolling or the coiling step. Here, if γ→α transformation occurs in a high temperature range, that is, carbides are generated in a high temperature range, in the cooling step after completion of the hot rolling, the carbides are coarsened in the cooling and coiling step thereafter. Therefore, in the case where a steel in the related art is used as the element of the hot rolled steel sheet, from the viewpoint of making the carbides fine, it is preferable to optimize the production condition in such a way that γ→α transformation occurs in a low temperature range of about 620° C. or lower after completion of the hot rolling. On the other hand, in a low temperature range of, for example, about 560° C. or lower, carbides are not precipitated sufficiently because diffusion of an alloy element becomes difficult.</p>', '<p id=""p-0029"" num=""0028"">For the above-described reasons, in order to precipitate fine carbides, which contribute to enhancement of the strength of the steel sheet, sufficiently in the ferrite phase, it is preferable to control the cooling stop temperature and the coiling temperature in the cooling and coiling step after completion of the hot rolling to become within a predetermined temperature range (about 560° C. to 620° C.) in such a way that γ→α transformation occurs at the same time with the coiling.</p>', '<p id=""p-0030"" num=""0029"">However, there is a tendency of the temperature of the end portion in the sheet width direction to become lower than the temperature of the central portion in the sheet width direction because of secondary cooling effect due to side flow of cooling water in the cooling step after completion of the hot rolling and an effect of standing to cool in the coiling step onward. As a result, the amount of precipitation of carbides becomes insufficient in the end portion in the sheet width direction as compared with that in the central portion in the sheet width direction, and strength variations occur.</p>', '<p id=""p-0031"" num=""0030"">In consideration of such circumstances, studies were conducted on the technique to precipitate fine carbides sufficiently into the end portion in the sheet width direction as well and finely disperse carbides stably in the sheet width direction of the hot rolled steel sheet. As a result, it was found that optimization of the hot rolling condition and the chemical composition of the steel were effective.</p>', '<p id=""p-0032"" num=""0031"">Specifically, it was found that a temperature decrease of the end portion in the sheet width direction was able to be minimized by suppressing temperature variances in the sheet width direction of the steel sheet at the time of completion of the finish rolling in the hot rolling and changing the flow rate of cooling water of a run-out table from the flow rate in the related art.</p>', '<p id=""p-0033"" num=""0032"">Also, it was found that the thermal stability of fine carbides precipitated in the ferrite was able to be enhanced by optimizing the chemical composition of the steel and hard-to-coarsen fine carbides were obtained. Specifically, it was found that fine carbides, which were carbides containing Ti and which exhibited excellent thermal stability, were obtained by allowing the steel to contain predetermined amounts of C, Si, Mn, and Ti and contain no V or have a reduced V content.
