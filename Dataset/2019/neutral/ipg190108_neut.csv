Specifically, a pharmaceutical composition comprising drug-containing granules having mechanical strength yields a viscous solution upon contact with a water-containing solvent and thereby prevents the abuse by an abuser (abuse through nasal inhalation, abuse through injection, or abuse through snorting or injection of an extracted drug) through the use of its property of exhibiting extraction resistance by which the drug is not easily extracted using water-containing solvents, various organic solvents or mixed solvents thereof.</p>', '<p id=""p-0021"" num=""0026"">In the conventional way of using polyethylene oxide in abuse deterrent formulations, polyethylene oxide resides close to the drug, and an approach of applying a temperature equal to or higher than the softening point because of its material properties is adopted. As a result, more rigid tablets or granules having mechanical strength (flexibility) are formed, and abuse deterrent formulations can be provided. However, polyethylene oxide is a heat-labile substance. Thus, not only is polyethylene oxide itself decomposed to decrease its function, but the decomposition product presumably reacts compositely with the drug so that the drug is decomposed. Therefore, a manufacturing method using a heating process (hot melt extrusion method) is not always the best method. In addition, a method for producing tablets by the hot melt extrusion method requires special apparatus and is therefore not versatile.</p>', '<p id=""p-0022"" num=""0027"">In a further possible approach, polyethylene oxide is physically isolated from a drug.

Further studies have revealed that tablets exhibit immediate disintegration by adding a hydrophobic additive to the granules of polyethylene oxide. As mentioned later, since the drug release unit of this formulation is a multiple unit, components that exhibit tablet disintegration have been prepared as granules such that the tablets disintegrate rapidly and disperse as granules after disintegration of tablets. The extractability of drug into various organic solvents, particularly, methanol, has been found to be high for formulations produced by the hot melt extrusion method using polyethylene oxide.

The gene (SLC7A5) encoding System L amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) was shown to be over-expressed in murine lymphoma cells generated via T cell deletion of the pten tumor suppressor and also in human T-cell Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL)/lymphoma (T-LL) cells, by intensive researches. Then, in the current studies, the present inventors utilized a certain LAT1 selective inhibitor (for instance, O-(5-amino-2-phenylbenzoxazole-7-yl)methyl-3,5-dichloro-L-tyrosine or its pharmacologically acceptable salt, hereinafter referred to as “COMPOUND-JP”). COMPOUND-JP decreased leukemic cell viability and proliferation, induced transient autophagy which was followed by apoptosis; in addition, COMPOUND-JP was able to alter the in vivo growth of xenografted luciferase-expressing-tPTEN−/− cells administered into nude mice. In contrast, COMPOUND-JP was non-toxic to normal murine thymocytes and to human peripheral blood lymphocytes. At a molecular level, COMPOUND-JP inhibited the constitutive activation of mTORC1 and Akt. COMPOUND-JP triggered an Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) mediated by the CHOP transcription factor associated with cell death. Curiously, the present inventors also generated a COMPOUND-JP-resistant tPTEN−/− clone which was CHOP induction deficient. In addition, the present inventors observed that COMPOUND-JP could synergized with rapamycin, dexamethasone, doxorubicin, velcade and L-asparaginase to alter leukemic cell viability. The results demonstrate that targeting essential amino acid influx mediated via LAT1 may be an efficient broad spectrum adjuvant approach to treat deadly T-cell malignancies.</p>', '<p id=""p-0019"" num=""0037"">That is, the experimental results generated from the current studies support the notion that T-ALL and T-LL cells, and tPTEN−/− mice, rely on a high level of amino-acid influx mediated via LAT1 in order for the cancer cells to survive and proliferate. Inhibiting LAT1 using COMPOUND-JP affected the constitutive activation of the mTOR pathway which sustained the survival of tPTEN−/− tumor cells, triggered a CHOP-dependent—cell death response and displayed interesting in vitro adjuvant drug properties.</p>', '<p id=""p-0020"" num=""0038"">According to the Quantitative results of a neutral amino acid transporter, LAT1 gene and LAT2 gene expressed in an established culture cell derived from various cancers of a human being, the LAT2 was expressed in only 5 kinds of cells. However the LAT1 mRNA was expressed in all of the 46 kinds of cells, and it can be said to be a cancer-type transporter. On the other hand, the expression of the LAT2 is zero or extremely low level in a cancer cell, and it can be understand to be a normal type. And dose-dependent decrease of the proliferation activity of COM-JP was apparently recognized in both cells of a 44As3-1 cell derived from human scirrhous stomach cancer and a Panc-1 cell derived from human pancreatic cancer. An inhibitory effect on the proliferation of COM-JP depending on the LAT1 expression level can be expected also in many other LAT1-expressing cancer cells.</p>', '<p id=""p-0021"" num=""0039"">Next, the results of the effect about stomach cancer, pancreatic cancer and large intestine cancer when COM-JP and other agents were used in combination. First, according to the effect on the proliferation of a 44As3-11 cell derived from human scirrhous stomach cancer when COM-JP and other agents (Gemstabine and Paclitaxel) were used in combination, the proliferation of a 44As3-11 cell derived from human scirrhous stomach cancer when COM-JP and other agents were used in combination, the inhibitory effect due to the combination was resulted from the addition of each single effect, and showed a so-called additive effect. Next, according to the effect on the tumor growth in a nude mouse model inoculated with a HT-29 cell derived from human large intestine cancer when COM-JP and 5-FU were used in combination, with the combination of both, the increase of the residual tumor in each single group was further decreased. It was revealed that this combined effect is additive, and due to the difference of the action mechanism of both pharmaceuticals. The efficacy that can be further enhanced by such combination compared with each single effect of the effectiveness of treatment is fully expected at colon cancer treatment in the clinical. Medicinal such it is possible to further enhance each sole therapeutic effect of the combination is also fully expected in colon cancer treatment in the clinical. Finally, according to the synergistic effect on the tumor growth in a nude mouse model (SOI model) inoculated in the same site with a HT-29 cell derived from human large intestine cancer when COM-JP and CDDP were used in combination, each efficacy that was not recognized in the single administration of each of COM-JP and CDDP was apparently recognized in the combination of COM-JP and CDDP.

The movement causes a flow of air (hereinafter, the flow may be referred to as an ion stream), and the positively charged droplet is atomized by the ion stream in a direction in which the droplet is away from the electrostatic atomizing device.</p>', '<p id=""p-0013"" num=""0012"">In this case, the electric field is oriented in a direction in which the second electrode extends. Therefore, a substance normally is atomized in the direction in which the second electrode extends, i.e., in a direction to the electrostatic atomizing device, so that the atomized substance easily adheres to the device surface (hereinafter, this phenomenon may be referred to as a spray-back).</p>', '<p id=""p-0014"" num=""0013"">However, according to the electrostatic atomizing device of the present invention, the second opening is provided so that a ratio in which the atomized substance adheres to the device surface may be reduced. In other words, a shape and a size and the like of the second opening are appropriately adjusted, so that the ratio in which the atomized substance adheres to the device surface is reduced. This makes it possible to prevent the spray-back. Further, in a case where the atomized substance is prevented from adhering to the device surface, a hand of a user does not get wet in holding the electrostatic atomizing device, and the electrostatic atomizing device can have higher portability.</p>', '<p id=""p-0015"" num=""0014"">Still further, an electric charge amount of the droplet and a size of the droplet are controllable by use of a change in strength of the ion stream by a change in shape and size of the second opening. The electric charge amount of the droplet and the size of the droplet serve as important factors in determination of an effect of the atomized substance which effect is yielded in use of the electrostatic atomizing device. Thus, the electrostatic atomizing device of the present invention yields an effect of preventing the spray-back and realizing atomization suitable for a purpose of use by controlling the electric charge amount of the droplet and the size of the droplet.</p>']"

Further, the liquid circulated by the external pump is guided from the first liquid inflow passage of the plug into the liquid storing container via the second liquid inflow passage of the socket. Furthermore, an outside air to be replaced by an amount corresponding to the decreased amount of liquid stored in the liquid storing container is guided from the outside space of the liquid storing container into the inside space thereof via the second gas passage of the socket and the first gas passage of the plug.</p>', '<p id=""p-0013"" num=""0012"">In this manner, the connector according to one aspect of the present disclosure has a structure capable of causing the liquid stored in the liquid storing container to flow to the outside, causing the liquid that has flown to the outside and circulated to flow into the liquid storing container, and introducing an outside air corresponding to the decreased amount of liquid stored in the liquid storing container.</p>', '<p id=""p-0014"" num=""0013"">Further, the socket included in the connector according to one aspect of the present disclosure can be reliably attached to the plug without requiring any troublesome operation, because the ball lock mechanism allows the plurality of lock balls to be engaged with the engagement grooves formed in the outer peripheral surface of the opening of the liquid storing container and fixes the plurality of lock balls to the engagement grooves, respectively.</p>', '<p id=""p-0015"" num=""0014"">In the connector according to one aspect of the present disclosure, the ball lock mechanism may include: the plurality of lock balls; a first cylindrical member having a plurality of opening holes, the opening holes being formed with a cylindrical shape about the first axial line and having a diameter smaller than an outer diameter of each of the lock balls; a second cylindrical member that is formed with a cylindrical shape about the first axial line and disposed at an outer peripheral side of the first cylindrical member, the second cylindrical member including a regulating portion that regulates the lock balls stored in the opening holes, respectively, to be engaged with the engagement grooves; and an urging force generation unit that urges the second cylindrical member against a location where the regulating portion contacts the lock balls, one end of the urging force generation unit being formed along the first axial line and fixed to the first cylindrical member, the other end of the urging force generation unit being formed along the first axial line and fixed to the second cylindrical member.</p>', '<p id=""p-0016"" num=""0015"">According to the connector having the structure as described above, when the socket is attached to the opening of the liquid storing container in which the plug is fixed to the inner peripheral surface thereof, the operator causes the second cylindrical member to be pulled upward along the first axial line and withdrawn so as to prevent the regulating portion from contacting the lock balls. This allows the operator to attach the socket to the plug in a state where the locking by the ball lock mechanism is released.</p>', '<p id=""p-0017"" num=""0016"">Further, the operator detaches the second cylindrical member after attaching the socket to the plug, thereby allowing the socket to be fixed to the outer peripheral surface of the opening without requiring any troublesome operation.

Accordingly, when the liquid is a slurry containing an abrasive or the like (a slurry in which solid particles are dispersed), the solid particles adhere to the section where the passage sectional area decreases locally, which deteriorates the liquidity of the liquid.

A urea production process to which the present invention is applied is a general urea production process. As general urea production processes, commercially known are processes based on known urea production technologies such as a complete circulation process and stripping process. The general urea production process includes, as indispensable steps, two steps which are a urea synthesis step of synthesizing urea from a raw material feed to produce a urea synthesis liquid, and a urea purification step of purifying the urea synthesis liquid to produce an aqueous urea solution. Further, as steps which are appropriately added to these steps, there are included a recovery step of collecting unreacted materials separated in the urea purification step, a urea concentrating step of concentrating the aqueous urea solution from the urea purification step up to concentration necessary for finishing, and a finishing step of forming the concentrated aqueous urea solution into a finished product such as prilled urea. Hereinafter, the present invention will be described with description of respective steps.</p>', '<p id=""p-0016"" num=""0015"">In the urea synthesis step, urea is synthesized from ammonia and carbon dioxide which are raw materials under a high temperature (175 to 200° C.) and high pressure (130 to 200 kg/cm<sup>2</sup>G) condition. A urea synthesis liquid from the urea synthesis step includes urea, ammonium carbamate as an unreacted material, ammonia, water and the like. Such a urea synthesis liquid is purified in the urea purification step. In the urea purification step, ammonium carbamate is decomposed into ammonia and carbon dioxide by heating of the urea synthesis liquid under reduced pressure from synthesis pressure, and ammonia and carbon dioxide are separated and purified from the urea synthesis liquid to form an aqueous urea solution.</p>', '<p id=""p-0017"" num=""0016"">Obtained is an aqueous urea solution containing a minute amount of ammonia and carbon dioxide from the urea purification step. The aqueous urea solution is sent to the urea concentrating step. In the urea concentrating step, the aqueous urea solution is heated in a vacuum state and concentrated up to concentration necessary for the finishing step. Generally, it is concentrated up to about 99.7% for production of prilled urea, and up to 96 to 98% for production of granular urea. The concentrated aqueous urea solution is formed into prilled urea, granular urea or the like in the finishing step, which are then shipped to markets. Meanwhile, ammonia and carbon dioxide separated from an aqueous urea solution in the urea purification step are sent to the recovery step. In the recovery step, ammonia and carbon dioxide are dissolved in water and then condensed. The condensed water is sent back to the urea synthesis step as a recovered liquid and utilized for urea synthesis.</p>', '<p id=""p-0018"" num=""0017"">In contrast to the above-described general urea production process, the present invention draws and separates a part of a urea synthesis liquid from the urea synthesis step or an aqueous urea solution from the urea purification step, or a part of both of these solutions. Then, the urea synthesis liquid and/or aqueous urea solution is crystallized to produce solid crystal urea. Timing at which a part of the solution containing urea (urea synthesis liquid and/or aqueous urea solution) is separated targets preferably an aqueous urea solution in or after the urea purification step. Because, the urea synthesis liquid contains ammonium carbamate or ammonia in high concentration, and therefore, the utilization of the urea synthesis liquid might affect a crystallization process. An aqueous urea solution from the urea purification step contains a small quantity of ammonium carbamate and ammonia, and therefore, it is suitable as an object for a crystallization treatment.</p>', '<p id=""p-0019"" num=""0018"">When a part of an aqueous urea solution from the urea purification step is separated, an aqueous urea solution directly after the urea purification step may be separated, or a subsequent aqueous urea solution may be separated. For example, as to a urea production process having the above-described urea concentrating step, a part of an aqueous urea solution between the urea purification step and the urea concentrating step may be separated. Further, a part of an aqueous urea solution in the urea concentrating step may be separated. Furthermore, both of the aqueous urea solutions may be separated.</p>', '<p id=""p-0020"" num=""0019"">The present invention sets a partially separated urea synthesis liquid and/or aqueous urea solution as an object, and crystallizes urea contained in the urea synthesis liquid and/or aqueous urea solution in the urea crystallization step. Concrete treatment contents in the urea crystallization step include a treatment of first, heating the partially separated urea synthesis liquid and/or aqueous urea solution to evaporate water, while suppressing the generation of biuret. The treatment includes a step of generating slurry containing crystal urea. The generated slurry includes solid urea crystals dispersed in the aqueous urea solution. The urea crystallization step further includes a step of subjecting the slurry to solid-liquid separation into crystal urea and a mother liquid. Hereby, urea crystals are collected.</p>', '<p id=""p-0021"" num=""0020"">Slurrying of the urea synthesis liquid and/or aqueous urea solution in the urea crystallization step is performed with a crystal generation apparatus such as a crystallization tank (crystallization tower), a crystallizing tank or crystallizer. Treatment conditions for generating slurry preferably include pressure and temperature, at which the urea synthesis liquid and/or aqueous urea solution can be heated in vacuum at relatively low temperatures to crystallize urea. Concrete treatment conditions preferably include heating the aqueous urea solution at 60 to 80 mmHg (abs.) in pressure and 50 to 80° C. in temperature. It is possible to evaporate water and to obtain crystal urea by heating under such conditions while suppressing decomposition of urea and generation of biuret in the solution. As a consequence of the treatment, urea is crystallized to generate slurry composed of solid crystal urea and the aqueous urea solution. In a step of generating slurry by the crystallization, it is preferable to perform the treatment until the crystal urea concentration (crystal urea/(crystal urea+urea in aqueous solution)) becomes 20 to 45% by mass.</p>', '<p id=""p-0022"" num=""0021"">Then, the slurry thus generated is subjected to solid-liquid separation to give solid crystal urea. As to concrete methods of solid-liquid separation, those by a filtering device, a centrifugal separator and the like are preferable. Meanwhile, it is unnecessary to make crystal urea be in a completely dried state containing no moisture. Crystal urea after a solid-liquid separation may contain moisture in around 1 to 3% by mass.</p>', '<p id=""p-0023"" num=""0022"">Moreover, a mother liquid obtained with crystal urea by a solid-liquid separation is water containing urea (aqueous urea solution). The mother liquid after a solid-liquid separation can be circulated into a crystal generation apparatus for generating slurry and be retreated. Further, it may be treated as a waste liquid without circulation into the crystal generation apparatus.</p>', '<p id=""p-0024"" num=""0023"">Incidentally, as described above, in an ordinary urea production process, there may be such a case that a biuret amount contained in a urea synthesis liquid from the urea synthesis step or contained in an aqueous urea solution from the urea purification step increases due to a change in operation conditions such as lowering of an operation load. In this case, it is estimated that biuret concentration in a mother liquid of slurry generated in the urea crystallization step also increases. Then, since crystal urea after a solid-liquid separation in the urea crystallization step is accompanied with a minute amount of mother liquid of slurry, obtained crystal urea might be not suitable for production of a high-purity aqueous urea solution.</p>', '<p id=""p-0025"" num=""0024"">In the present invention, there is devised a countermeasure for the probability of increase in a biuret amount in an aqueous urea solution as described above. The countermeasure is to make it possible to send back, to the urea synthesis step, a part of a mother liquid obtained by a solid-liquid separation of slurry generated in the urea crystallization step. As described above, it is possible to lower the biuret amount in the mother liquid and to reduce an amount of biuret accompanying crystal urea after a final solid-liquid separation, by returning a part of the mother liquid to the urea synthesis step. Biuret contained in the mother liquid sent back to the urea synthesis step is in a state of reaction equilibration in a reactor in the urea synthesis step, and therefore, it changes to urea reversibly.</p>', '<p id=""p-0026"" num=""0025"">When a part of the mother liquid is to be sent back as described above, the mother liquid may be sent directly from the urea crystallization step to the urea synthesis step. Further, when a urea production process has a recovery step, the mother liquid may be sent back to the recovery step and the mother liquid may be sent back to the urea synthesis step with a recovered liquid from the recovery step. It is possible to dissolve ammonia/carbon dioxide separated in the urea purification step in the mother liquid, by sending back the mother liquid to the recovery step. Hereby, an amount of an absorption solvent (water) sent to the recovery step can be decreased. As a consequence of the reduction of the amount of an absorption solvent, water decreases in a recovered liquid to be returned to the urea synthesis step. The decrease in water in a recovered liquid is favorable for a urea synthesis reaction, and there is such an advantage that a synthesis ratio of urea can be improved from relation of a urea synthesis equilibrium.</p>', '<p id=""p-0027"" num=""0026"">However, it is not always necessary to perform a partial recycle of a mother liquid after subjecting slurry to a solid-liquid separation, which is described above.

53,US10174111B2,Therapeutic drug for malignant tumors,utility,"['<p id=""p-0007"" num=""0009"">The disease mechanism of malignant tumor is complex, with many parts unclear. Thus, many medical needs remain unfulfilled in the field. The inventors have discovered that growth of malignant tumor cells is suppressed when the malignant tumor cells are contacted with an anti-LSR antibody as a number of researches are conducted on malignant tumor. Furthermore, when an LSR siRNA was transfected into malignant tumor cells, growth of malignant tumor cells was also suppressed in this case. In addition, when an anti-LSR antibody was actually administered to a malignant tumor model mouse, a notable decrease in tumor volume was observed. In view of the above, it was elucidated that an LSR suppressant such as an anti-LSR antibody is effective in treating malignant tumor.

Aspects of the present invention have been completed on the basis of the findings.</p>', '<p id=""p-0014"" num=""0013"">First, the present inventors, from the results of investigations regarding the relationship between a steel sheet microstructure and the above-described properties such as tensile strength, yield ratio, elongation, and stretch flange formability, considered the following.</p>', '<p id=""p-0015"" num=""0014"">a) In the case where martensite or retained austenite having a high hardness exists in a steel sheet microstructure, voids are formed at the interface between ferrite and martensite or retained austenite, in particular, at the interface with the soft ferrite during a punching process of a hole expanding test, and the voids combine with each other and grow in a subsequent hole expanding process, which results in cracking. Therefore, it is difficult to achieve good stretch flange formability. On the other hand, there is an increase in elongation owing to retained austenite and soft ferrite being included in the steel sheet microstructure. Therefore, in order to achieve good elongation and stretch flange formability while achieving strength of 1180 MPa or more, it is preferable to decrease a difference in hardness among constituent phases in a microstructure by forming a microstructure including retained austenite with a small volume fraction of ferrite.</p>', '<p id=""p-0016"" num=""0015"">b) Although there is an increase in yield ratio in the case where bainite and tempered martensite have a high dislocation density in a steel sheet microstructure, there is only a small influence on elongation.</p>', '<p id=""p-0017"" num=""0016"">Therefore, the present inventors diligently conducted investigations, and, as a result, found that, by controlling the volume fractions of soft phases, from which voids originate, and hard phases, and by controlling the distribution of cementite grains precipitated in a hard intermediate phase such as tempered martensite or bainite, it is possible to achieve an increase in elongation and a high yield ratio while achieving satisfactory strength and stretch flange formability as a result of decreasing the difference in hardness from the hard phases.</p>', '<p id=""p-0018"" num=""0017"">In addition, it was found that, specifically, by adding B in an appropriate amount, by forming a microstructure of a hot-rolled steel sheet including a uniform bainite structure (the volume fraction of bainite at a position located at ¼ of the thickness in the thickness direction is 100%), by performing a heat treatment (first heat treatment) in order to control the distributions of chemical elements and carbides in the hot-rolled steel sheet, by then performing cold rolling on such a hot-rolled steel sheet, and by then controlling conditions, for example, cooling conditions and holding conditions after cooling has been performed in a continuous annealing process (second heat treatment), since it is possible to control bainite transformation, the formation of retained austenite, and the distribution of cementite precipitated mainly in bainite and tempered martensite, it is possible to manufacture a steel sheet having the desired microstructure.</p>', '<p id=""p-0019"" num=""0018"">Here, it is important to use B as a quench hardenability increasing chemical element. That is, in the case where, for example, Mn is added in an excessive amount as a quench hardenability increasing chemical element, there is an increase in the hardness of tempered martensite and martensite, and there is a decrease in the martensite transformation start temperature. Therefore, it is necessary that a cooling stop temperature be lowered in a cooling process which is performed prior to a tempered-martensite-forming process and in which martensite transformation occurs. There is an increase in cost because an excessive cooling capacity is needed. By adding B, since it is possible to achieve satisfactory hardenability without decreasing the martensite transformation start temperature, there is a decrease in the otherwise necessary cost for cooling. Moreover, by adding B, it is also possible to suppress the formation of ferrite and pearlite in a cooling process after finish rolling has been performed in a hot-rolling process, which is effective for achieving the steel sheet microstructure of a hot-rolled steel sheet including a uniform bainite structure. In addition, after having achieved the microstructure of a hot-rolled steel sheet including a uniform bainite structure, by homogenizing the concentration distributions of C and Mn in a first heat treatment which is subsequently performed, and by further controlling a heating rate to be within a specified range in a second heat treatment which is subsequently performed, since it is possible to decrease the grain diameters of ferrite and martensite and to control the distribution of cementite grains, it is possible to form the desired steel sheet microstructure.</p>', '<p id=""p-0020"" num=""0019"">The present inventors found that, by controlling Mn content to be 2.4% or more and 3.5% or less, by adding B in an amount of 0.0002% or more and 0.0050% or less, and by further controlling conditions of annealing performed after hot rolling and cold rolling have been performed, it is possible to control the distribution of cementite grains to be precipitated while decreasing the grain diameters of ferrite and martensite and controlling the volume fraction of retained austenite to be sufficient to achieve satisfactory elongation.

If such a general situation is considered, the number of channels to be determined as to whether the charge signals are found or not is not necessarily one. When plural channels carry charge signals, the detection signal in each channel may include overlap signals of charge and induced signals. Even when such overlapped signals are presented, it is possible to have correct determination for finding a charge signal in the detection signal, if appropriate conditions are adopted in the aspects of the present invention.</p>', '<p id=""p-0027"" num=""0026"">Next, features in the aspects of the present invention will be explained individually. The detection signal data sequence is a sequence of time-series digital data sampled from a detection signal. The detection signal data sequence has been converted into a digital format in an appropriate sampling frequency and quantization bit length that would not cause any problematic loss of information, after preprocessing as needed.</p>', '<p id=""p-0028"" num=""0027"">The timing data calculation step handles the detection signal data sequence. The function of the timing data calculation step is to calculate a timing data sequence that will be used in determining timing of interaction between the radiation ray and the semiconductor. The timing data sequence is, for example, a data sequence suitable for deriving the interaction time point between the radiation ray and the semiconductor. The timing data calculation step includes a numerical computation that uses the detection signal data sequence data values, especially ones in a time window, or a first waveform shaping window (1st WSW), out of consecutively incoming values of the detection signal data sequence. It follows that, the waveform indicated by the timing data sequence is a shaped waveform of the detection signal data sequence. The timing data calculation step can be implemented by continuous numerical computation over the values of the detection signal data sequence. It is to be noted that, in a preferred aspect of the present invention, an energy value derivation from a charge value in a channel is performed through waveform shaping of the detection signal data sequence of the same channel over a longer time window, or second waveform shaping window (2nd WSW) (charge signal energy calculation step). The timing data calculation step may be a numerical computation process on a waveform of the detection signal data to obtain a trapezoidal wave or a triangular wave that reflects features of the original waveform. For example, let us assume the case when the detection signal data sequence to be processed is a sequence of data that represents following series of values: values of no detection, such as “0”, up until a time point, values varying on or after the time point, and values relaxing according to a time constant afterward. Then, a triangular wave having a height (pulse height) corresponding to the values in the variation is obtained by the process (see, for example, Non Patent Documents 1 and 2). Such a process can be explained in a simple qualitative manner as a combination of a low-pass filter operation (integration operation) and a high-pass filter operation (differentiation operation), where the integration enables averaging for avoiding a miss of significant signal due to noise, whereas the differentiation enables precise determination of timing. The process is implemented in an embodiment of the invention into a numerical computation circuit to calculate convolution with a predetermined function by use of so-called a digital filter technique. Timing data sequences obtained through such a process are also time-series data sequences unique to channels. It should be noted that the charge signal energy calculation step is a numerical computation process that uses 2nd WSW, which is longer than the 1st WSW, and is similar to the timing data calculation step mentioned above. In the charge signal energy calculation step, however, the conditions are set suitable for energy calculation purposes. For example, the convolution calculation is carried out with another predetermined function that is suitable for energy calculation in the charge signal energy calculation step.</p>', '<p id=""p-0029"" num=""0028"">Data values in the timing data sequence are compared with a threshold value, or first threshold value in the aspects of the present invention. The first threshold value is used to find a rise of the signal and to initiate the clocking of the predetermined delay time, or to start timing operation. Then a data value in the timing data sequence at the delay time after the clocking initiated time point, or for samples equivalent to the delay time, is compared with another threshold value, or second threshold value. The delay in the time realizes delayed determination that shifts the determination timing along the time axis. A data value in the timing data sequence to be compared with the second threshold value is called a timing data value for determination. A detection signal data sequence corresponding timing data value for determination reached the second threshold value is determined as a detection signal data sequence carrying a charge signal, or one from a channel that collected the electric charge in the aspects of the present invention. This is the process of the determination in the aspects of the present invention. In this regard, since the first and the second threshold values act differently, the values for the first and the second threshold values are set independently; the first and second threshold values may be set to the same or different values with each other. Moreover, in comparing the data values in the timing data sequence with the first or the second threshold value, the data value is regarded as having reached the threshold value when the data value becomes the identical value of the threshold or when their magnitude relationship is inverted than ever. This also applies to comparison operation to determine the elapse of the delay time for specifying the timing data value for determination. Although there may be various different implementations for the comparison and delay on the surface depending on setting of the origin or positive/negative signs for the values, whether the comparison or delay operation is performed or not should be understood based on the substantial aspect of the invention that is appropriate for defining the scope of the invention.</p>']"

The Ag—CuO-based alloy can be manufactured by internally oxidizing an Ag—Cu alloy or an Ag—Cu—Ni alloy.</p>', '<p id=""p-0021"" num=""0020"">Here, since the Ag—CuO-based alloy can be manufactured by internal oxidation of the Ag—Cu-based alloy, an electrode material can be manufactured more efficiently than separately manufacturing the plate material constituting each metal layer and the like as described above. More specifically, preferred manufacturing method is a method for manufacturing an electrode material including the steps of jointing a plate material made of an Ag—Cu-based alloy to the both sides of the plate material made of Cu to form a clad material, and heat-treating the clad material to internally oxidize a part of the plate material made of an Ag—Cu-based alloy to form a surface layer made of the Ag—CuO-based oxide-dispersed strengthened alloy. As described above, a three-layer (Ag—Cu-based alloy/Cu/Ag—Cu-based alloy) clad material is previously manufactured, and the Ag—Cu-based alloy layer thereof is partially internally oxidized, whereby the manufacturing process can be simplified, and the surface layer and the intermediate layer can be integrated. The thickness of the Ag—CuO-based alloy layer to be a surface layer can be adjusted in the conditions of internal oxidation treatment set forth below, and an electrode material with an objective structure can be manufactured without making oxygen reach the core material layer (Cu) in the treatment.</p>', '<p id=""p-0022"" num=""0021"">In the preferred manufacturing method described above, first, plate materials made of an Ag—Cu alloy (Ag—Cu—Ni alloy) are stacked and rolled to be jointed to the both sides of the core material made of Cu to manufacture a clad material. The thickness of the clad-jointed plate material may be adjusted by rolling it or the like before internal oxidation treatment.</p>', '<p id=""p-0023"" num=""0022"">The clad material manufactured above is internally oxidized to form an Ag—CuO-based alloy layer. As the conditions of internal oxidation treatment, the heat treatment temperature is preferably set at 500 to 700° C. At a heat treatment temperature of less than 500° C., oxygen atoms are not enough diffused into the Ag—Cu-based alloy, and it takes quite a long time to oxidize a range of a certain level or more depth from the surface of alloy, thus it is not practical. On the other hand, at a heat treatment temperature exceeding 700° C., the rate of the progression of internal oxidation is too high, thus it becomes difficult to control the thickness of the surface layer.</p>', '<p id=""p-0024"" num=""0023"">The oxygen partial pressure is preferably set at 0.01 MPa or more and less than 0.3 MPa. At an oxygen partial pressure of less than 0.01 MPa, it is difficult to supply the amount of oxygen necessary for enough internal oxidation into the Ag—Cu-based alloy. On the other hand, at an oxygen partial pressure of 0.3 MPa or more, the rate of the progression of internal oxidation is too high, thus it becomes difficult to control the thickness of the surface layer, as in the case of raising the heat treatment temperature as described above.</p>', '<p id=""p-0025"" num=""0024"">The heat treatment time is preferably set at 3 to 15 hours. The thickness of the surface layer is controlled by heat treatment temperature, oxygen partial pressure and heat treatment time. When the heat treatment time is short, a predetermined thickness of the surface layer is not obtained, and when the heat treatment time is too long, the intermediate layer is thinned and causes deterioration of strength. In addition, when oxidation reaches an interface between the intermediate layer and the core material layer, the core material layer is oxidized to markedly deteriorate the bonding strength between the intermediate layer and the core material layer.</p>', '<p id=""p-0026"" num=""0025"">The internal oxidation conditions described above are adjusted, whereby the Ag—CuO-based alloy layer can be formed, and a five-layer structure electrode material can be manufactured. The clad material manufactured as described above may be thereafter rolled to adjust the total thickness, as necessary. Moreover, the clad material can be subjected to cutting processing, slit processing and bend processing into a shape and dimension required as a movable electrode of a thermal fuse.</p>']"
