2,US10201459B2,Method for manufacturing absorbent article,utility,"['<p id=""p-0006"" num=""0005"">In Patent Literature 1, before a welding process and a cutting-and-separating process, the elastic members are divided in advance so as to produce contract force; this makes it possible to prevent the welded area from contracting together with the elastic members when cutting the elastic members. This makes it possible to manufacture a diaper which has a good appearance and keeps up soft feeling on the side sealings thereof. But, in this method, when dividing the elastic member, the continuous sheet which is to be the exterior materials of the diapers is likely to be damaged by tools such as a cutter. If the damaged continuous sheet is heat-welded, it is possible that sufficient welding strength cannot be ensured on the damaged part.</p>', '<p id=""p-0007"" num=""0006"">In the method of Patent Literature 1, a problem concerning leg elastic members provided along the leg openings of a diaper may occur. For example, low fitting of the leg openings causes a gap between a wearer\'s legs and the leg openings when a diaper is worn. In order to prevent excrement leakage from such a gap, the leg elastic members are provided so as to produce stretching/contraction force which is greater than that produced by other elastic members; that is, the leg elastic members are provided being stretched so as to be subjected to greater stress than other elastic members. This improves the fitting of the leg openings of a diaper. But, if the leg elastic members are divided on the welded section as in Patent Literature 1, this may make the leg elastic members to be less likely to be held on the continuous sheet. As a result, the leg elastic members are removed from the leg openings of a diaper, and this is likely to make the fitting of the leg openings worse.</p>', '<p id=""p-0008"" num=""0007"">In view of the problem described above, it is an advantage of the invention to provide a pull-on diaper in which the welding strength of the side parts thereof is sufficient and the leg elastic members thereof are less likely to be removed.</p>']"

However, the joining between the main body portion of the suspension link and the collar is performed at a plate thickness portion of the main body portion of the suspension link in many cases. For this reason, if the plate thickness of the main body portion of the suspension link is simply made thin for the purpose of the cost reduction, the contact portion between the collar and the main body portion is reduced as the plate thickness of the main body portion becomes thinner, and thus the welding of the connection portion between the collar and the main body portion may be easily peeled away not to satisfy strength of the coupling portion.</p>', '<p id=""p-0008"" num=""0006"">The present invention has been made to solve the above problems, and an object thereof is to provide a suspension link having excellent reliability in strength or the like of the coupling portion of the suspension link while being inexpensive.</p>']"

In this laser cleaving method, cleaving is performed through use of thermal stress. Then, considering the above-mentioned two types of glass roll manufacturing methods, the position of the cleaving unit using the laser cleaving method is generally defined, in the former case, to be the position on the transverse conveyance unit after the glass film ribbon is drawn from the forming unit (in the down-draw method, after the glass film ribbon further passes through a direction changing unit), and is generally defined, in the latter case, to be the position on the transverse conveyance unit configured to convey the glass film ribbon in the transverse direction while taking out the glass film ribbon from one glass roll and taking up the glass film ribbon into the other glass roll.</p>', '<p id=""p-0011"" num=""0010"">In this case, the glass film ribbon has flexibility, thereby causing a problem in that wrinkles are generated in the glass film ribbon while the glass film ribbon is being conveyed in the transverse direction by the transverse conveyance unit. When the wrinkles are generated in the glass film ribbon as described above, a minute bending stress is generated in the wrinkles and the vicinity thereof, and hence an unexpected bending stress caused by the wrinkles may be applied in addition to the thermal stress during the laser cleaving. As a result, there may arise a problem of difficulty in achieving stable laser cleaving.</p>', '<p id=""p-0012"" num=""0011"">Note that, in Patent Literature 2, there is disclosed a configuration including an air supply unit (air knife) configured to push, at an upstream position of a laser cleaving position, a waviness, which is caused by the wrinkles generated in the glass film ribbon, to an upstream side of the laser cleaving position while the glass film ribbon is being conveyed in the transverse direction by the transverse conveyance unit. However, the air supply unit does not eliminate the waviness caused by the wrinkles but moves the wrinkles (waviness) to the upstream side from the laser cleaving position.</p>', '<p id=""p-0013"" num=""0012"">Therefore, as also presumed from FIGS. 1 of Patent Literature 2, in the case where the wrinkles are excessively moved to the upstream side from the laser cleaving position by the air supply unit, it is predicted that the wrinkles arrive at the direction changing unit of the glass film ribbon (part in which the moving direction changes from a vertical direction to the transverse direction) or the vicinity thereof. When such situation occurs, for example, the glass film ribbon wobbles on the periphery of the direction changing unit due to the arrival of the wrinkles.

Therefore, it is possible to satisfy the lower limit (for example, 2 microliters) of a dispensing accuracy guarantee range of the dispenser or the dispensing chip. In addition, when an amount required for one analysis is dispensed from the mixed reagent in the reaction liquid adjustment step, the required amount can generally satisfy the lower limit of the dispensing accuracy guarantee range as well, as a result of adding several types of reagents thereto.</p>', '<p id=""p-0008"" num=""0007"">Here, for example, in a case where an amount of mixed reagent for N analyses is prepared, the minimum value of N is set based on the lower limit of the dispensing accuracy guarantee range of the dispenser or the dispensing chip. Meanwhile, the maximum value of N is set based on the upper limit of the dispensing accuracy guarantee range of the dispenser or the dispensing chip, or the capacity of a vessel which is used when preparing the mixed reagent. In this specification, the value of N is referred to as the number of times of mixed reagent adjustment, and the minimum value and the maximum value of N are respectively referred to as the minimum number of times of mixed reagent adjustment and the maximum number of times of mixed reagent adjustment. The number of times of mixed reagent adjustment is a value equal to or greater than the minimum number of times of mixed reagent adjustment and equal to or less than the maximum number of times of mixed reagent adjustment.</p>', '<p id=""p-0009"" num=""0008"">For example, in a case of preparing a mixed reagent by using a reagent of 0.5 microliters for one analysis and a dispensing chip of which the lower limit of the dispensing accuracy guarantee range is 2 microliters, the minimum number of times of mixed reagent adjustment, that is, the minimum value of the number N of times of mixed reagent adjustment indicates the amount for 4 times. In addition, for example, in a case of preparing a mixed reagent by using a reagent of 25 microliters for one analysis and a dispensing chip of which the upper limit of the dispensing accuracy guarantee range is 200 microliters, the maximum number of times of mixed reagent adjustment, that is, the maximum value of the number N of times of mixed reagent adjustment indicates the amount for 8 times.</p>', '<p id=""p-0010"" num=""0009"">As described above, as the mixed reagent is prepared based on the number of times of mixed reagent adjustment, with respect to the reagent which is required to be dispensed in a minute amount and is thereby difficult to satisfy the dispensing accuracy with one analysis, it is possible to perform the analyses in a state where the dispensing accuracy is satisfied. However, for example, in a case where the number of times of mixed reagent adjustment is set to a fixed value at all times, depending on the number of requested samples (in other words, the required number of times of analysis), there is a case where a surplus of the mixed reagent is generated. In this specification, the surplus of the mixed reagent is referred to as an unused mixed reagent, and the number of times of analysis which can be executed with the unused mixed reagent is referred to as the number of unused mixed reagents.

The defects at the edges of box pattern displays will be detected as burn-in.</p>', '<p id=""p-0010"" num=""0009"">The inventors have investigated the correlation between the above-described defects, such as burn-in and stains, and the reduction in seal part width for achieving liquid crystal panels having narrower frames. At the periphery of a liquid crystal panel, a seal part to be filled with a liquid crystal material is formed by stacking a TFT substrate and a color filter substrate on top of each other. The reduction in seal part width allows moisture, oxygen, and other impurities to readily permeate a liquid crystal layer from the outside of the liquid crystal panel. The inventors conducted tests to find that no defects occur when the liquid crystal panel is placed in a nitrogen atmosphere and that noticeable defects occur in an oxygen atmosphere, determining that the permeation of oxygen into the liquid crystal panel is a cause of the defects. That is to say, it is necessary to take measures to prevent oxidation in liquid crystal panels.</p>', '<p id=""p-0011"" num=""0010"">When a liquid crystal panel is manufactured by a liquid crystal one-drop fill process, a photocurable sealing material is applied to either of the substrates by drawing with a dispenser, and a liquid crystal material is dropped onto either of the substrates, after which the substrates are stacked on top of each other and then irradiated with UV light or visible light to cure the sealing material. The light to be applied is selected according to the main reactive wavelength of a photopolymerization initiator in the sealing material. However, at the periphery, it is necessary to provide space for disposing light-shielding members such as wires, and when the width of the seal part is narrow, sufficient space not overlapping the light-shielding members cannot be provided. In the light-shielding region overlapping the light-shielding members, the sealing material is not irradiated with sufficient light, thus leading to insufficient curing of the sealing material, and as a result, components, mainly, low-molecular components in the sealing material are likely to flow out into the liquid crystal material in the liquid crystal layer. The sealing material typically contains a photopolymerization initiator in addition to a major proportion of epoxy materials and acrylic materials, and if the highly reactive photopolymerization initiator flows out into the liquid crystal material, and light from a backlight having enhanced luminance is applied, defects are highly likely to occur. However, to achieve a liquid crystal panel having a narrower frame, it is necessary to reduce the seal part width while maintaining an overlapping area of the light-shielding region and the seal part, and thus it has been difficult to reduce the amount of outflow into the liquid crystal layer.</p>', '<p id=""p-0012"" num=""0011"">These various investigations have suggested that photopolymerization initiators cause burn-in and stains according to the following flow.</p>', '<p id=""h-0007"" num=""0000"">(1) Radical Generation</p>', '<p id=""p-0013"" num=""0012"">Upon irradiation of a liquid crystal panel with light (amount of energy: hν) from a backlight, an unreacted photopolymerization initiator, which has not reacted during a photocuring treatment of a sealing material, is excited to generate radicals, as expressed by the following formula (A-I).

Note that the CA does not have a function of detecting an RLF occurring in the secondary cell (SCell). This is because the SCell is a supplementary cell, and thus no serious problem occurs for the communication as long as the radio link in the PCell is normally connected.</p>', '<p id=""p-0011"" num=""0013"">Meanwhile, inter-base station carrier aggregation (inter-eNB CA) in which cells of different radio base stations (eNBs) are simultaneously used has been proposed (Non-patent Literatures 3 and 4). For example, a cell of a macro base station (Macro eNB (MeNB)) and a cell of a low-power base station (Low Power Node (LPN)) are simultaneously used as a PCell and an SCell, respectively. In inter-base station (or inter-eNB) carrier aggregation, bearers are independently configured in the PCell and the SCell and communication is performed between an UE and the MeNB and between the UE and the LPN.</p>', '<p id=""p-0012"" num=""0014"">If the architecture of ordinary CA is applied to the inter-eNB CA, it is conceivable that an MeNB controls configuration of radio parameters and the like for both the PCell and the SCell in the inter-eNB CA. In this case, RLF detection in the PCell by the UE and the reconnection of the radio link in the PCell can be performed in a manner similar to that for the ordinary CA. However, RLF detection and accompanying radio-link reconnection in the SCell are not performed. Accordingly, the MeNB cannot recognize an RLF occurring in the SCell, thus causing a possibility that a state where communication (e.g., data transmission) is not properly carried out in the SCell continues. The continuation of the state where communication is not properly carried out in the SCell causes a possibility of occurrences of packet losses.</p>', '<p id=""p-0013"" num=""0015"">One of the objects of the present invention is to provide a radio communication system, a radio station, a radio terminal, a communication control method, and a program which are contribute to reduction of packet losses caused by an occurrence of a radio link problem (e.g., an RLF) in a secondary cell during carrier aggregation of a plurality of cells served by different radio stations.</p>']"
