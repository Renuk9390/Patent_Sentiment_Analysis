In this method, the primary side non-contact charging module and the secondary side non-contact charging module are positioned by a magnet provided at at least one of the modules so that the magnets provided at the both modules or the magnet provided at one module and a magnetic sheet provided at the other module attract each other.</p>', '<p id=""p-0008"" num=""0008"">Further, there is another method in which the primary side non-contact charging module and the secondary side non-contact charging module are positioned accurately without utilizing a magnet.</p>', '<p id=""p-0009"" num=""0009"">For example, there is a method in which the primary side non-contact charging module and the secondary side non-contact charging module are physically (as a shape) and forcibly positioned by fitting a protruding portion formed on a charging surface of a charger provided with the primary side non-contact charging module into a recessed portion formed at an electronic device provided with the secondary side non-contact charging module. There is still another method in which the primary side non-contact charging module detects a position of a coil of the secondary side non-contact charging module to thereby automatically move a coil of the primary side non-contact charging module to the position of the coil of the secondary side non-contact charging module. There is yet another method in which a large number of coils are provided at a charger to thereby enable charging even if a mobile device is placed at anywhere on a charging surface of the charger.</p>', '<p id=""p-0010"" num=""0010"">However, L values of the coils provided at the respective non-contact charging modules largely vary between a case where a magnet is used for positioning the primary side non-contact charging module and the secondary side non-contact charging module and a case where a magnet is not used. Resonant frequency of the electromagnetic induction for power transmission is determined by utilizing the L values of the coils provided at the respective non-contact charging modules.</p>', '<p id=""p-0011"" num=""0011"">Accordingly, there is a problem in that it is difficult to share the non-contact charging modules between a case where a magnet is used for positioning the primary side non-contact charging module and the secondary side non-contact charging module and a case where a magnet is not used.</p>', '<p id=""p-0012"" num=""0012"">Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a non-contact charging module which can suppress variation of an L value of a coil provided at the non-contact charging module in both of a case where a magnet provided at the other non-contact charging module serving as a counterpart for power transmission is used and a case where a magnet is not used for positioning a primary side non-contact charging module and a secondary side non-contact charging module, and which can be suitably used in both of a case where a magnet is used and a case where a magnet is not used, and which can realize downsizing, and also to provide an electronic device and a non-contact charging device.</p>']"

Specifically, in an eluate test in The Japanese Pharmacopoeia, Sixteenth Edition, which is required to be performed on aqueous injection containers, a Nylon 6 film whitens or cracks when being heated in hot water at 121° C., and thus cannot meet standards. Such a problem in the hot water resistance is thought to be improved when using Nylon 11 or Nylon 12 in place of Nylon 6 as the polyamide. However, the applicant of the invention has found that in the case in which the thickness of the heat-resistant polyamide resin layer in the multi-layer film is increased and the amount of the polyamide used is increased, the amount of an eluate when the multi-layer film is held in hot water increases when using Nylon 11 or Nylon 12 as the polyamide. Specifically, when a pH test is performed in which a multi-layer film is held for a certain time in hot water at 121° C. to measure the pH of the hot water after the holding, the difference in the pH between the hot water and a blank test liquid increases.

Accordingly, by use of the production method, there can be produced a high-purity aqueous urea solution not containing impurities such as aldehyde. However, in the method described in PTL 1, although additive impurities such as aldehyde do not exist, occasionally ammonia, which is an unreacted component in the synthesis, is contained. Since ammonia also corresponds to an impurity in the standard of a reducing agent for SCR, removal of ammonia becomes necessary.</p>', '<p id=""p-0009"" num=""0008"">Further, with a conventional technique in PTL 1, there is a problem more troublesome than the removal of impurities such as ammonia. The problem is how to handle biuret (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>N<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>: dimer of urea) that may be contained in an aqueous urea solution after a synthesis step. Biuret is also regulated in concentration in the standard of a high-purity aqueous urea solution for SCR, and must be suppressed to a certain amount or less. However, biuret is not a general impurity having a different chemical composition, and therefore, the separation is difficult. Consequently, once generated biuret exists with urea after a synthesis step in a urea production process.</p>', '<p id=""p-0010"" num=""0009"">Furthermore, an additional problem of biuret also exists in addition to the difficulty of separation from an aqueous urea solution. The additional problem is that the generated quantity of biuret changes according to operation conditions of a plant, even if the urea production plant is the same. The additional problem will be described in detail below.</p>', '<p id=""p-0011"" num=""0010"">Biuret is generated by heating a urea synthesis liquid or an aqueous urea solution after a urea synthesis step at high temperatures, and a generated quantity becomes larger as an operation time at high temperatures becomes longer. In a general urea plant, a process design and an equipment design are performed based on a design production quantity, and the optimum operation condition is set. Furthermore, under the optimum condition, the influence of the problem of biuret is small. However, due to a shortage of a raw material, performance deterioration of equipment or the like, a situation is not uncommon in which the operation needs to be performed at a production quantity lower than the design production quantity. Under an operation condition of a low production quantity, retention time of a urea synthesis liquid or an aqueous urea solution in equipment increases. The increase in the retention time brings about a state in which biuret is generated easily. Accordingly, even if a plant generates a small quantity of biuret in an aqueous urea solution under an operation condition for a design production quantity, biuret might be generated excessively as a result of the change in the operation condition.</p>', '<p id=""p-0012"" num=""0011"">The conventional method for producing a high-purity aqueous urea solution having been described cannot cope with the increase in a biuret concentration due to the change in an operation condition.

The method utilizes an aqueous urea solution after urea synthesis in the urea production plant for production of a high-purity aqueous urea solution. Furthermore, the method can produce a high-purity aqueous urea solution containing a small quantity of impurities and biuret. Here, concrete indicators of a high-purity aqueous urea solution in the present invention is that urea concentration is 32 to 33% by mass in an aqueous urea solution, biuret concentration is not more than 0.2% by mass, and concentration of impurities other than urea/water is not more than 0.4% by mass.</p>']"

In order to cope with these changes, optimization of characteristics other than the above fundamental physical property values known in the related art is required. That is to say, as the liquid crystal display element, the VA type or the IPS type is also widely used, a display element of which the size is also an extra-large size equal to or longer than 50 inches is put into practical use. With the increase in a substrate size of a liquid crystal display element, in an injection method of the liquid crystal composition into a substrate, the mainstream type of the injection method has been changed from a vacuum injection method in the related art to a drop injection (ODF: One Drop Fill) method, but the problem in that drop marks generated when the liquid crystal composition is dropped on a substrate leads to a decrease in display quality became an issue. Furthermore, in the liquid crystal display element manufacturing process by the ODF method, the optimal liquid crystal injection amount needs to be dropped according to the size of the liquid crystal display element. Thus, the liquid crystal injection amount greatly deviates from the optimal value, the balance of the refractive index and the driving electric field of the liquid crystal display element which is designed in advance is lost, and display defects such as generation of spots and poor contrast occur. In particular, in a small-sized liquid crystal display element which is frequently used in smart phones in recent years, it is difficult to control deviation from the optimal value to be within a certain range since the optimal liquid crystal injection amount is small. Therefore, in order to maintain a high yield of the liquid crystal display element, for example, effects with respect to rapid pressure change or impact in the dropping apparatus which occurs when the liquid crystal is dropped are required to be small, and performance capable of continuously and stably dropping a liquid crystal over a long period of time is also required.</p>', '<p id=""p-0010"" num=""0009"">Accordingly, in the liquid crystal composition used in an active matrix driving liquid crystal display element driven by a TFT element or the like, while maintaining characteristics and performance that are required as a liquid crystal display element such as high-speed response performance and the like, it is desired to have a development taking into consideration the manufacturing method of the liquid crystal display element, in addition to having characteristics of a high specific resistance value or a high voltage holding ratio which has been considered to be important in the related art and having stability against external stimulations such as light and heat.

Such erroneous detection may also occur when significant energy has been given to the semiconductor by radiation rays, and thus the induced signal is significant. As a result, it may be impossible to determine which channel actually detected the radiation rays. Moreover, when operations applied to the induced signals are ones that should have been applied to a charge signal to obtain radiation energy and detection timings, the information obtained is incorrect and useless, and therefore the amount of unnecessary processing would build up.

However, when the material having high strength is mixed, the relative ratio of the material with a negative intrinsic birefringence value such as polystyrene is reduced. Therefore, the thickness of the phase difference film has to be increased in order to obtain a desired retardation, which makes it difficult to reduce the thickness of the phase difference film.</p>', '<p id=""p-0013"" num=""0012"">As another possible strategy for making the phase difference film less breakable, a combination of a low-strength layer and a high-strength layer may be employed to form a phase difference film having a multi-layer structure.

On the other hand, a plurality of lenses provided on a lower face of the optical path change element is in the face-to-face relationship with a plurality of light emitting elements (or light receiving elements) provided in the optical module. The light beams emitted from the respective light emitting elements of the optical module are, after being collimated by the lenses, reflected by the corresponding aspherical reflection faces and converged at the end faces of the optical fibre.</p>', '<p id=""p-0011"" num=""0010"">By the way, the general optical coupling device is provided on each of boards inserted as a stack into a rear surface of the server and other equivalent apparatuses in many cases. It is therefore said preferable to downsize the optical coupling device to the greatest possible degree for integrating the boards in order to facilitate saving a space. However, the optical path change element of Patent Document 1 is configured so that the light beams entering the aspherical reflection faces are to be reflected by internal reflection based on a difference in refractive index between a material composing the aspherical reflection face and the air, resulting in an apprehension that the refractive index decreases due to occurrence of scattering and other equivalent phenomena when the aspherical reflection faces are damaged. It is therefore considered that the aspherical reflection faces are provided in V-shaped groove with a difficulty of being damaged in the optical coupling device of Cited Document 1. Such a problem, however, arises that the optical path change element is scaled up by a block shape because of providing the V-shaped groove. Further, there is a possibility that the aspherical reflection faces are not only damaged but also dewed with moistures and attached with foreign matters. When dewed with the moistures and attached with the foreign matters, a reflection condition changes, and deterioration of the material is easy to occur, whereby light usage efficiency becomes easy to decrease. As a result, there is an apprehension that accuracy of transmitting information decreases. To cope with this apprehension, though examining film formation on the aspherical reflection face, in the case of the optical path change element of Cited Document 1, after molding the aspherical reflection faces within the V-shaped groove, minute film forming particles flying straight from outside are shadowed by the V-shaped groove in a step of forming the films on the aspherical reflection faces, and there is an apprehension that the uniform films are disabled from being formed on the aspherical reflection faces.</p>', '<p id=""p-0012"" num=""0011"">Next, a scheme of covering the upper surface of the optical path change element with a plate-shaped cover member is examined against the problem of being dewed with the moistures and attached with the foreign matters.

It is also feasible to restrain reflection films from being exfoliated and damaged particularly on the occasion of forming the reflection films on the aspherical reflection faces. However, when the optical path change element is, in addition to having the block shape, fitted with the cover member, the optical coupling device has a larger height from the board and might interfere with a neighboring board on the occasion of the use by stacking the boards. This causes an increase in interval between the boards, resulting in a factor for hindering the integration.</p>', '<p id=""p-0013"" num=""0012"">One or more embodiments of the present invention provide an optical coupling device and an optical path change element used therein, which are capable of ensuring downsizing while keeping stable coupling efficiency without depending on an external environment but do not hinder integration of boards when attached to the boards.</p>']"

First, for this input apparatus, a load standard (referred to as an “input reception load standard”) for receiving an input and another load standard (referred to as an “input cancellation load standard”) for canceling the input are defined. The input apparatus receives an input if the load detection unit detects a pressure load meeting (exceeding) the input reception load standard, and after reception of the input, it cancels the input if the load detection unit detects a pressure load failing to meet (“under” or “equal to”) the input reception load standard.</p>', '<p id=""p-0014"" num=""0013"">Next, in the drag processing, when a finger or a stylus carrying out an input operation slides on the touch panel in a state that the pressure load of the input operation (touch) applied, to the object displayed on the display unit meets the input reception load standard, the drag processing is started in response to such sliding and the object is displayed at a position corresponding to a position of the finger or the like sliding on the display unit. Then, when the pressure load of the input operation (touch) applied to the object fails to meet the input cancellation load standard, the object being dragged is dropped (when the load detection unit detects the load failing to meet the input cancellation load standard, the object is displayed at a position on the display unit corresponding to the position of the touch panel touched by a touch object such as the finger or the like), then the drag processing ends.</p>', '<p id=""p-0015"" num=""0014"">Since in the drag processing as above the input apparatus for receiving the input based on the pressure on the touch panel applied by the user determines a start and an end of the drag based on a pressure load detected by the load detection unit, there is the possibility to drop the object being dragged at a position unintended by the user. For example, in order to start dragging, the user needs to slide the finger or the like applying pressure to the object. While the pressure is applied to the object in a vertical direction before sliding, it is necessary to apply the pressure in a horizontal direction as well as in the vertical direction in order to slide the finger or the like. Accordingly, even if the same pressure (scalar quantity) is applied to the input apparatus by the user before and after the start of sliding, a vector of the pressure applied to the input apparatus after the start of sliding is different from that before sliding, as a result. The pressure in the vertical direction is therefore reduced after start of sliding because of an increase in the pressure in the horizontal direction. When the pressure in the vertical direction is reduced like this, the pressure load detected by the load detection unit fails to meet the input cancellation load standard, which may cause unintended drop of the object.</p>', '<p id=""p-0016"" num=""0015"">In addition, the object may also be dropped at an unintended position if, during sliding; the pressure in the horizontal direction is increased for the purpose of increasing a sliding speed, unintentionally reducing the pressure in the vertical direction.</p>', '<p id=""p-0017"" num=""0016"">Accordingly, an object of the present invention in consideration of such conditions is to provide an electronic apparatus for receiving an input in accordance with a pressure load capable of reducing the possibility to drop an object in the drag processing against a user\'s intention.</p>']"

For this reason, as shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 3</figref>, since the distance of the macro eNB from the pico UE is greater than the distance from the pico eNB, the path loss corresponding to a signal transmitted from the pico UE is greater than that of the pico eNB.

For example, <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 4</figref> shows a computer simulation result illustrating a relationship of an average value and variance of the measured SINR versus an input SINR.

For example, in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 4</figref>, in order to reduce the measurement error of SINR and thus to secure channel quality estimating accuracy, the base station needs to receive SRS in a region where the influence of noise decreases (e.g., region where input SINR is 5 dB or higher).</p>', '<p id=""p-0028"" num=""0027"">As described above, base stations such as macro eNB and pico eNB estimate channel quality based on an SINR measured value measured using SRS transmitted from a terminal and thereby perform CoMP control. For this reason, when the measurement error of SINR is large, a base station having poor channel quality may be erroneously selected as a transmission point. Similarly, when the measurement error of SINR is large, an inappropriate transmission weight may be selected.

308,US10178674B2,Communication apparatus and method for discrete fourier transforming a time domain symbol to a frequency domain signal,utility,"['<p id=""p-0015"" num=""0015"">According to the above prior art, the base station divides an SC-FDMA signal (spectrum) of each terminal with an arbitrary frequency according to a state of availability of uplink frequency resources and a condition of the propagation path between a plurality of terminals and the base station, allocates a plurality of clusters thereby generated to a plurality of uplink frequency resources respectively and reports information showing the allocation result to the terminals. The terminal divides the SC-FDMA signal (spectrum) which is the output of DFT processing with an arbitrary bandwidth, maps the plurality of clusters to a plurality of uplink frequency resources allocated by the base station respectively and thereby generates C-SC-FDMA signals.</p>', '<p id=""p-0016"" num=""0016"">However, since a wide uplink radio frequency band (wideband radio channel) is frequency selective, the frequency correlation between channels through which a plurality of clusters mapped to different discontinuous frequency bands propagate decreases. Thus, even when the base station equalizes C-SC-FDMA signals (a plurality of clusters) through FDE processing, the equalization channel gain (that is, frequency channel gain after FDE weight multiplication) may considerably differ among the plurality of clusters. Therefore, the equalization channel gain may drastically change at a combining point (that is, the point of division at which the terminal divides the SC-FDMA signal) of the plurality of clusters. That is, a discontinuous point may occur in a variation (that is, envelope of reception spectrum) in the equalization channel gain at the combining point of the plurality of clusters.</p>', '<p id=""p-0017"" num=""0017"">Here, to keep minimal the loss of orthogonality of a DFT matrix in all frequency bands (that is, the sum of frequency bands to which a plurality of clusters are mapped) to which C-SC-FDMA signals are mapped, the equalization channel gain in all frequency bands to which the plurality of clusters are mapped needs to be a slow variation. Thus, when a discontinuous point occurs in a variation of the equalization channel gain at a combining point of the plurality of clusters as in the above described prior art, the orthogonality of the DFT matrix is considerably destroyed in the frequency band to which the C-SC-FDMA signals are mapped. Therefore, the C-SC-FDMA signals are more impacted by inter-symbol interference (ISI) caused by the loss of orthogonality of the DFT matrix. Especially when high-level M-ary modulation such as 64 QAM whose Euclidian distance between signal points is very short is used, the C-SC-FDMA signals are more impacted by ISI, and therefore deterioration of transmission characteristics is greater. Furthermore, as the number of clusters (the number of fractions of SC-FDMA signal) increases, the number of discontinuous points between clusters increases, and therefore ISI caused by the loss of orthogonality of the DFT matrix further increases.</p>', '<p id=""p-0018"" num=""0018"">The present invention has been implemented in view of such problems and it is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a radio communication apparatus and a signal division method capable of reducing ISI caused by the loss of orthogonality of a DFT matrix even when an SC-FDMA signal is divided into a plurality of clusters and the plurality of clusters are mapped to discontinuous frequency bands respectively, that is, when C-SC-FDMA is used.</p>']"
