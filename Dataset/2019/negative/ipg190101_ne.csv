0,US10165738B2,Blow operation device,utility,"['<p id=""p-0006"" num=""0005"">The demand trends for blow operation devices are shifting from engine-driven ones to electric-motor-driven ones, in consideration of environmental issues such as gas emission and noise. An electric-motor-driven blow operation device includes, as heavy objects, a battery and an electric motor. In the technique described above, the battery is a backpack type, but the blower having a heavy electric motor is held with one\'s hand for an operation. Therefore, a corresponding burden of heavy weight cannot be avoided.</p>', '<p id=""p-0007"" num=""0006"">In the conventional technique in which an operation is done while a blower portion of the blower is held with one\'s hand, the blower portion including the heavy electric motor and the like is supported by one arm. Since the reaction force from blowing air is added to the arm during the operation, there is a problem that fatigue in the arm increases as the operation makes progress. Particularly with a blowing-and-gathering operation by blowing air, an efficient operation can be performed by blowing and gathering generated compressed air from both the right and left. However, to realize this, the blower portion of the blower needs to be held respectively by both right and left arms to blow air from two directions, and there has been a problem that the burden on the arms of an operator further increases.</p>', '<p id=""p-0008"" num=""0007"">Addressing such a problem is one example of an issue of the present invention. That is, the issue of the present invention is to, for example, reduce the burden of heavy weight on an operator and further reduce fatigue in an arm of the operator, with an electric-motor-driven blow operation device.</p>']"

4,US10165942B2,"Optical tomographic imaging apparatus, control method therefor, and program therefor",utility,"['<p id=""p-0007"" num=""0006"">In general, an OCT apparatus used for such a fundus inspection as described above conducts a focus adjustment based on a diopter of an eye to be inspected. The focus adjustment is conducted by moving a focus adjustment mechanism inside the apparatus so that the image becomes brighter by bringing a light used for an inspection into focus on a fundus portion of the eye to be inspected. On the other hand, use of the above-mentioned wide angle lens adapter requires the focus adjustment to be conducted at a position different from a predetermined position, but a focus position may deviate from a focus adjustment range (movable range of the focus lens) of the eye to be inspected depending on a change amount of the focus position. Therefore, the adjustment to an optimal focus position becomes unable to be conducted, or the focus adjustment itself becomes difficult. Further, the OCT apparatus is further demanded to have an optical system exhibiting a narrower field angle in order to acquire the tomographic image within a narrower fundus range with high resolution power, which leads to the same problem.</p>', '<p id=""p-0008"" num=""0007"">In view of the above-mentioned problem, one object of the present invention is to enable the focus adjustment with respect to an object to be inspected even when an optical member for changing a field angle is inserted in order to change the field angle of an image acquiring area of the tomographic image, and to acquire a clear tomographic image with a focus on the object to be inspected.</p>']"

Thus, an image acquisition device including a plurality of active pixel sensors described above has a problem that when all the active pixel sensors are reset for each read time, the read time becomes longer by the time required for the reset and power consumption of the image acquisition device also increases compared to a case where there exists an active pixel sensor that is not reset. An image acquisition device including a radiological-image acquisition panel of an active pixel type according to the related art also has a problem similar to the aforementioned problem because all the active pixel sensors are reset for each time required to read data for one two-dimensional image.</p>', '<p id=""p-0010"" num=""0009"">The invention was made to solve the aforementioned problems and an object thereof is to provide a radiological-image acquisition device that realizes improvement of a frame rate and suppression of power consumption by reducing a total time for acquiring data for a two-dimensional image.</p>']"
9,US10166016B2,Medical retractor,utility,"['<p id=""p-0012"" num=""0011"">However, the steel-made utensils have various other drawbacks besides the above-mentioned drawbacks. For example, when a medical operating instrument is disposed on the periphery of a field of operation, the instrument shields the field of operation and the periphery of the field of operation so that visibility of the field of operation and the periphery of the field of operation is lowered thus obstructing an operation. To be more specific, with respect to an operation target part located in a deep part of a human body, it is necessary to change a degree of incision between a superficial layer tissue and a deep layer tissue and hence, it is necessary to use both a first wound retractor which retracts a tissue on a superficial layer side and a second wound retractor which retracts a tissue on a deep layer side at the same time. In this case, there is a possibility that a tissue incised by the first wound retractor is shielded by the second wound retractor and this shielding of the tissue is one of factors which lower the visibility of the field of operation.</p>', '<p id=""p-0013"" num=""0012"">This drawback relating to visibility of a field of operation has a possibility of becoming conspicuous with the plastic-made wound retractor disclosed in above-mentioned patent literature 1 when compared to a metal-made wound retractor. That is, plastic is inferior to metal in strength and hence, to enable a plastic-made wound retractor to acquire a strength equivalent to a strength of a steel-made wound retractor, a size of the plastic wound retractor is liable to become larger and hence, there is a high possibility that visibility of a field of operation is lowered compared to a case where a metal-made wound retractor is used.</p>', '<p id=""p-0014"" num=""0013"">The present invention has been made in view of such circumstances, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a medical retractor capable of ensuring visibility of a field of operation and in the periphery of the field of operation while realizing the reduction of weight of the retractor compared to a conventional steel-made retractor. It is another object of the present invention to provide a medical retractor capable of enhancing visibility of a field of operation and in the periphery of the field of operation compared to a conventional steel-made retractor.</p>']"

However, these cutting tools cannot exhibit sufficient effects with respect to hard organs, and the hemostasis effect thereof is also insufficient. Further, these cutting tools require high-speed vibration causing cavitation, and hence the device of each tool is enlarged. A conductive wire connected to a portion of the tool, which is held by a hand of an operator, is thick and heavy, thereby imposing restrictions on operations. Further, the cutting tools are expensive.</p>', '<p id=""p-0016"" num=""0017"">Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a surgical tool capable of excising a hard solid organ such as cirrhotic liver or cutting the organ into a groove without causing bleeding.</p>', '<p id=""p-0017"" num=""0018"">(Object 2)</p>', '<p id=""p-0018"" num=""0019"">The related-art solid organ cutting tool can be used for crushing, washing away, aspirating, and cutting off a solid organ. However, thin blood vessels are also crushed to cause bleeding, and hence the hemostasis function of the related-art solid organ cutting tool is weak. Thus, bleeding occurs continuously in a surgical operation field although it is not heavy bleeding, thereby being difficult for an operator to observe the surgical operation field and to perform a surgical operation. To address this, a hemostasis operation is separately required.</p>', '<p id=""p-0019"" num=""0020"">Accordingly, it is another object of the present invention to provide a surgical tool capable of concurrently performing hemostasis while crushing a solid organ.</p>']"

That is, as shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 8</figref> of the present invention, a long-extended grip member is necessary for the conventional valve cusp sizer, and an attachment portion for the grip member is necessary to be reserved in a sizer head. Accordingly, it is difficult to insert the sizer head of the conventional valve cusp sizer into a base of the narrow aorta. Further, it is necessary to take care not to injure a vessel wall by contacting the sizer head with the vessel wall.</p>', '<p id=""p-0012"" num=""0011"">In addition, since the conventional valve cusp sizer has the structure that the grip member is attached to each of the differently-sized sizer blocks, the capacity of a container in which a plurality of types of valve cusp sizers are accommodated becomes large as shown in, for example, FIG. 1 of Patent Document 1. In a case that the container is too large, it is difficult to keep the container at an operator\'s hand. Therefore, the plurality of types of valve cusp sizers are kept at a place far from an operation field, and a delivery of the valve cusp sizers is needed between the operator and an assistant each time when another size of valve cusp sizer is needed. Such a delivery of the valve cusp sizers results in a loss of operative time.</p>', '<p id=""p-0013"" num=""0012"">Accordingly, at the present time, a valve cusp sizer which is small and easy to handle is required.</p>']"

For example, a cell of a macro base station (Macro eNB (MeNB)) and a cell of a low-power base station (Low Power Node (LPN)) are simultaneously used as a PCell and an SCell, respectively. In inter-base station (or inter-eNB) carrier aggregation, bearers are independently configured in the PCell and the SCell and communication is performed between an UE and the MeNB and between the UE and the LPN.</p>', '<p id=""p-0012"" num=""0014"">For example, a radio terminal (UE) performs voice communication (called “Voice over IP (VoIP)” or “Voice over LTE (VoLTE)”) in the P Cell and performs data communication (e.g., FTP) in the SCell. In general, VoIP communication is not performed often. Meanwhile, FTP traffic changes according to the user activities. In the case of the ordinary CA where cells of the same base station are used, the eNB can adaptively control the activation/deactivation of the SCell according to the FTP traffic. However, in the case where the PCell and the SCell are served by different eNBs, it is difficult for the eNB (e.g., an MeNB) that serves the PCell to adaptively control the activation/deactivation of the SCell served by the other eNB (e.g., an LPN) according to the FTP traffic provided in that SCell. Accordingly, for example, the UE has to unnecessarily decode a downlink control signal (PDCCH) in the SCell where communication is not performed often, thus causing a possibility that the electric power is wastefully consumed. This could cause a problem especially in the case where the resource scheduling of the PCell and that of the SCell are independently performed in different base stations. This is because when each radio base station independently performs scheduling, it is possibly difficult to use the PDCCH of the PCC for the scheduling of data transmission performed in the SCC (i.e., to perform the so-called cross-carrier scheduling).</p>', '<p id=""p-0013"" num=""0015"">Further, in the carrier aggregation, the SCell is activated on the precondition that the UE has an active connection with the PCell. In other words, the SCell is additionally or dependently activated on the condition that the UE is in connection with the PCell. Therefore, the UE cannot deactivate the PCell while maintaining the SCell in the activated state.

252,US10172148B2,"Communication terminal, communication method, storage medium on which communication program is stored, and communication system",utility,"['<p id=""p-0013"" num=""0013"">When a number of communication terminals using a same wireless frequency band in a wireless LAN for synchronizing stored contents with one another is small, data collision rarely occurs; however, as the number of communication terminals increases, a probability of occurrence of data collision rises, and a data collision count increases. Consequently, a problem arises that throughput in communication between the respective communication terminals degrades, causing difficulty in use of the wireless LAN.</p>', '<p id=""p-0014"" num=""0014"">In order to solve the problem, for example, a method described below may be considered. That is to say, all communication terminals (also referred to as nodes) connected to a wireless LAN are clustered in a plurality of nodes. Further, each node is controlled so as to operate on the basis of a time slot (a communication time period being a data transmission channel demarcated in a certain time interval) unified throughout all the nodes. Then, an opportunity (time slot) of transmitting data is allocated to each node on a cluster-by-cluster basis.</p>', '<p id=""p-0015"" num=""0015"">In order to allocate an opportunity (time slot) of transmitting data to each node on a cluster-by-cluster basis, a starting time of a time slot and the like need to be synchronized at all nodes.

256,US10172179B2,Method and apparatus for reconfiguring a bearer,utility,"['<p id=""p-0015"" num=""0014"">In certain scenarios, part or the whole of the radio bearer protocol stack may be moved from one termination point to another termination point, for instance from one eNB to another eNB. For non-split radio bearers this may be due to the UE roaming between cells controlled by separate eNBs. In this case some of the on-going transmissions in the discontinued user plane stack will be terminated before successful delivery of the corresponding PDCP SDUs has been ensured. To overcome the loss that would be the result of this termination, PDCP SDU retransmissions may be initiated after the radio bearer protocol stack move. So far, 3GPP RAN2 specifications have only specified how PDCP SDU retransmissions are handled for non-split bearers (that is, how PDCP SDU retransmissions are to be handled when the complete RAN protocol stack is moved). If it is required to reconfigure a split bearer as a non-split bearer, for instance due to the UE moving out of the coverage area of the small cell, while remaining in the coverage area of the macro cell, then this also requires at least the part of the radio bearer protocol stack within the SeNB to be moved. Applying the same retransmission techniques when reconfiguring a split bearer to a non-split bearer will lead to inefficient retransmission, as is described in greater detail below.</p>']"
